Residents who registered on the Electronic Vaccine Data System and selected the International Christian Family Church as their vaccination site are receiving their vaccines without having to step out of their car to queue.Johan Vander-Vyver, the first community member to get his COVID-19 vaccine at the drive-through vaccination site, was delighted to have received the jab in his car.“This is definitely a great initiative, that is hassle free. I’m being observed in my own vehicle, which also reduces the amount of contact with other people and limits any exposure to COVID-19. I strongly encourage other residents over 60 to consider the drive-through site,” he says.Some Ekurhuleni residents were so impressed with the service that they post-ed about it on Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality’s Facebook page.“My parents went there today and it was amazing. Organised, friendly, efficient staff. What an excellent idea! Well done,” says Gillian Dansie.“What an excellent way of keeping us – the over 60s safe,” says Marie de Bruyn.“I took my folks yesterday. Great initiative. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. All-in-all it was a pleasant experience, well done,” says Lyndsey Danielsen.Gauteng Health Ekurhuleni District Manager Terrance Magoro says the initiative is a way of adding more vaccination sites to reach as many people as possible. “This facility that we are in is quite large. It has three entrances and we are only using one at the moment. We will expand and open two more entrances so we can vaccinate more people… We want to reach 1 200 vaccinations per day at this facility,” he adds.Standard screening and verificationResidents who make use of the drive-through vaccination site still go through the standard COVID-19 screening and verification process, before receiving their vaccine, but they also stay in their car during this process.Following the screening, the COVID-19 shot is administered by a professional nurse. The patients then drive to the observation station where they are observed for 15 minutes, for any adverse vaccine effects.The site is open from 8am  Ekurhuleni residents receive their COVID-19 vaccines in their cars at a drive-through vaccination site.SOUTH AFRICA  has launched its first drive-through COVID-19 vaccination site.
AwezaMed bridges COVID-19 language divideAn innovative language app is helping ensure that South Africans receive Coronavirus Dis ease (COVID-19) infor mation in a language they are familiar with, potentially saving lives.
The local mobile app, AwezaMed, is aimed at breaking down language barriers to improve safety protocols, communication and other COVID-19-related information. According to the Department of Higher Education, Science and Innovation, language remains a serious challenge in conveying this life-saving information during the deadly pandemic, especially in a country like South Africa with 11 official languages.Multilingualism is vital to ensure healthcare professionals and patients understand each other and the voice-enabled AwezaMed app will help to make this possible.“In the context of healthcare, it is common that the healthcare provider and patient often do not share a common language.“This results in serious challenges, such as a poorer patient experience, incorrect diagnoses, increased stress levels for the patient and misunderstandings about post-consultation self-care instructions,” says Higher Education, Science and Innovation Minister Dr Blade Nzimande. AwezaMed was developed by the department’s entity, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. It features localised technology, such as speech rec ognition, text-to-speech and machine translation.“The app enables healthcare providers to access a phrase in English, translate it into any South African official language and play the phrase in the selected language,” says the Minister.The content of the app was developed in collaboration with health experts.The app, which currently works on any Android smartphone, also has a database of over 1 800 questions, reassurances, explanations, patient responses and key vocabulary curated by a team of medical professionals. In addition, automatic speech recognition allows for the recognition and transcription of speech in any of the 11 official languages, while machine translation takes input text in the source language and translates it into the target language.The Minister believes the app holds potential benefits for the public health sector beyond COVID-19, as it will go a long way towards improving trust between healthcare providers and patients, allowing for more diagnoses that are accurate and save lives.AwezaMed can be accessed free on the Google Play Store at http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=za.co.aweza.covid19.– SAnews.gov.za
