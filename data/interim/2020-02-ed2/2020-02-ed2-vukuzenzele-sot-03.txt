It also assists us in taking samples of the maize and soil.” Mbokane was financially unable to study further after matric but knew that agriculture held many opportunities for people with the will to work hard.“I started farming because I saw a gap that young people should explore and I went for it.”Mbokane employs three permanent staff members and hires 15 seasonal employees during peak periods.
