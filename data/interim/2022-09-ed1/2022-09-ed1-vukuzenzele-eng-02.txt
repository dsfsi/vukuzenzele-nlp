People who buy food off the zero-rated list can get a little more for their money, which helps them to put nutritious food on the table.According to Statistics South Africa (Stats SA), food and non-alcoholic beverages (NAB) cost 8.6% more in June this year than they did in June 2021.Stats SA said the food products that have increased the most are bread and cere als (which includes maize meal), meat and oils and fats – all of which are staple foods in many households.Bread and cereal products have increased by 11.2% since June 2021, up from 8.4% in May this year, when the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 1.1%. The monthly increase was 2.6%, with notable price rises for maize meal (5.2%), brown bread (3.2%) and macaroni (3%). In addition, meat prices increased by 9.5% from June 2021 to June 2022., and cost slightly more than they did in May 2022. Oils and fats increased annually by 32.5%, compared with 26.9% in May when the CPI increased. The high cost of sunflower oil, in particular, is putting extra strain on budgets.
Save with zero-rated goodsZero-rated goods were introduced by government in 1991 to help low-income households. Since the initial introduction, more items have been added to the list.According to the South African Revenue Service, zero-rated foods are taxed at a rate of 0% – this means people pay 15% less for these goods because they do not have to pay VAT.These items include:
• Brown bread• Dried mealies and mealie rice• Brown bread flour (excluding wheaten bran)• Samp• Eggs• Fresh vegetables and fruit• Dried beans• Lentils• Maize meal• Rice• Pilchards in tins or cans• Vegetable cooking oil (excluding olive oil)• Milk, cultured milk, milk powder and dairy powder blend• Edible legumes and pulses, such as peas, beans, peanuts, etcSanitary towels (pads) are also zero-rated, as are maternity pads and panty liners. Senior citizens must also ask their local shops if they give pensioners a discount, on certain days, on goods that are not zero-rated.
 vkin, peach gel and brown butter ice cream; Isibindi nechakalaka – butter basted ox liver, yellow lentil chakalaka and onion jus; and Iqanda, Isibindi noshatini – tartlet with roasted tomato relish, chicken liver and biltong-cured yolk crème.“When you get to Cape Town, you may not get a true reflection of what South Africa is about, so I decided to stay true to myself with traditional food to show visitors what we eat. I tell myself every morning I am telling my story; my interpretation of what Zulu food is. I hope people embrace it for what it is. We hope to elevate ordinary dishes to the exceptional. Cape Town has a diverse population, apart from international tourists; they all get to learn about Zulu food,” she says.
The World's 50 Best’s 50 Next list It was Molefe’s way of modernising traditional food that scored her a spot on the 50 Next list, which each year celebrates 50 people aged under 35 who are shaping the worldwide food scene. The competi-tion enables these brilliant young chefs to show off their cooking to the world.Molefe attended the awards ceremony in June in Bilbao, Spain, and says it was an inspirational day of discussions with other foodies.“I have been fortunate to get people from across the country and all age groups to come enjoy our food. People are prejudiced against offal (the internal organs of an animal used as food) and I want to show them that if you treat it right, it can taste just as delicious as any other cut of meat. I also want to promote nose-to-tail dining, to champion this sustainable way of eating,” Molefe says.Emazulwini also won the African Restaurant of the Year title at the fourth annual Luxe Restaurant Awards earlier this year.
Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan Emazulwini employs four people and Molefe has plans to grow her business. She says South Africa’s rich heritage is a tourist drawcard.As part of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan, the government has identified the tourism sector as one of the critical intervention areas and a key driver of economic recovery. The Department of Tourism, the private sector and other stakeholders collaborated to develop the Tourism Sector Recovery Plan, which will help form strategic partnerships between government and industry to ensure improved visitor experiences. This will be done by introducing e-visas, promoting tourist safety and making it easier for tour operators to get licences. v
