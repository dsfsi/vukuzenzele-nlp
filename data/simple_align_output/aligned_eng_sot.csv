","haufinyane ke sa tswa fumana monyetla wa ho kopana le ona marena ha ho ne ho bulwa palamente ya marena moo ho neng ho tshohlwa ditaba tsa bohlokwa tsa naha ena.
"
"what was particularly refreshing about the robust engagement was that traditional leadership has a keen appreciation of the difficult economic conditions facing our country, and want to be part of addressing the many challenges of underdevelopment and poverty in their areas.
","se ileng sa nkgahla haholo puisanong ya rona ke ho hlokomela hore le marena a ngongorehile ka maemo a boima a moruo naheng ena mme le ona a batla ho ba ka rolo ya tharollo ya mathata le bofuma dibakeng tsa ona.

","ke dutse ke bolela hore tso seletso ya moruo ka lebaka la sewa sa khorona, e tlameha ho kenyeletsa motho ohle, ho se be le ya siuwang kantle.

"the success of the economic reconstruction and recovery plan rests on forging strong partnerships between not just government, business and labour, but also with traditional leadership and other societal formations.

"a constant refrain from participants in the debate recently was that they do not want to be dependent on handouts or for their communities to perpetually look to government for financial assistance.

","a batla hore a fuwe tshe hetso le thupello a e hlokang mmoho le tikoloho e tla dumella setjhaba sa ona ho ikemela.

"what they would like to see is for rural areas to become centres of economic activity, industry and employment opportunity.
","a batla ho bona dibaka tsa mahaeng e ba dibaka tsa kgiro, ditsi tsa tlhahiso le ntshetso pele ya moruo.
"
"this mirrors the aspirations of the district development model (ddm), which was launched in 2019. traditional leaders are well positioned to ensure that district plans are informed by and respond to the real needs of communities and that they reflect the lived reality in rural areas.
","sena se tshwantshwa hantle le le ano la ntlafatso ya ditereke (ddm), le neng le thehwe ka 2019. marena a maemong a nepahetseng a ho netefatsa hore maano ana a ntlafatso ya ditereke a sebetsa hantle le hore a atlehisa ditlhoko tsa setjhaba sa ona dibakeng tsa mahaeng.
"
"just as the ddm supports localised programmes that focus on the needs, strengths and opportunities in specific areas, traditional leaders have pioneered their own approach to local economic development.
","jwalo ka ha leano la ddm le tshehetsa maano a ntlafatsang ditlhoko le menyetla diba keng tse itseng, marena le ona a na le tsela ya ona e pele ya ho ntlafatsa moruo dibakeng tsa ona.

","ke ntho e kgothatsang ho bona hore marena kaofela a tshehetsa leano lena mme a batla ho sebetsa mmoho le makgotla a metsaneng ho netefatsa katleho ya lona.

"during the debate in the national house of traditional leaders it was proposed that a major success factor for the investrural programme is that traditional structures are trained, strengthened and capacitated.
","puisanong ya rona pala menteng ya marena, ho ile ha hlahella hore leano lena la ntlafatso ya dibaka tsa mahaeng le ka atleha ha feela dikomiti tsa marena di fumana tshehetso le thupello.

"these range from agricultural projects to bioprospecting to renewable energy.
","hara ona re ka bala a tsa temo, tshebediso ya dimela le diphoofolo ho etsa meriana esitana le tsoseletso ya matla a motlakase.
"
"what was evident is that the institution of traditional leadership understands that professionalisation is necessary for rural businesses in the form of small, medium and micro enterprises and cooperatives to become part of the mainstream economy.
","se ileng sa hlokomeleha ke hore marena a elellwa taba ya hore ho tle dikgwebo tsa mahaeng di atlehe mme e be karolo ya moruo wa naha ena, di tlameha ho sebetsa ka tsela ya profeshenale ho sa natsehe hore ke tse thuthuhang, tse mahareng, tse hodileng kapa tsa matsema.
"
"the traditional leaders who spoke presented their vision of ‘developmental monarchs’, who see themselves as not just custodians of heritage but also as drivers of economic prosperity and progress.
","marena ohle a buileng mona, a bontshitse taba ya hore ona ha se marena a she bileng paballo ya setso feela, empa a ntshetsa pele le taba ya moruo dibakeng tseo a busang ho tsona.

","a hlwahile diprojeke tse ngatanyana le menyetla ya moruo e tla theha menyetla ya mesebetsi le ho ntlafatsa maphelo a batho ba mahaeng.
"
"traditional leaders have also expressed their willingness to play an active part in the land reform process.
","marena a boetse a ikemise ditse ho nka karolo kabong botjha ya mobu.
"
"since 2018, traditional leaders have made around 1 500 000 hectares of communal land available for development, and it is hoped this will increase in future.
","ho tloha ka selemo sa 2018, marena a se a nehelane ka mobu o ka bang dihektara tse 1 500 000 bakeng sa ntshetsopele, mme re tshepa hore a tla fana ka o mong nakong e tlang.

","hore re tle re be le leano le tiileng ka taba ena, re du mellane ka ho ba le pitso ya mopresidente ya ditaba tsa mobu isao.

","pitsong ena, ho tla tshohlwa ditaba tsa kabo ya mobu le kgahlamelo ya sena mobung wa marena o dibakeng tsa mahaeng.

"the tone of the debate in the national house was a fitting reflection of a climate in which economic recovery is foremost among our considerations.
","se bonahetseng haholo puisanong ya palamente ena ya marena, ke hore tsoseletso botjha ya moruo e ne e le yona ntlhakgolo.

"at the same time it was a promising signal that traditional leaders appreciate their role in being part of the national recovery effort through being proactive and innovative.
","ka ho le leng, sena e ne e le sesupo sa hore marena a thabela ho ba karolo ya tsoseletso ya moruo ka mahlale le maano a ona.

","esale sewa sena se ropoha, mekgatlo ya bo dumedi e nkile mehato ya phadimeho le e hlwahlwa ya ho fokotsa ho nama ha lefu lena hara barapedi.
