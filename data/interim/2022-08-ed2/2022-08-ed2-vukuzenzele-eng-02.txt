Vuk’uzenzele6August 2022 Edition 2 GENERALBursary opportunities Owen Mngadi  Successful entre preneur Siyanda Mthethwa (36) has responded to the escalating fuel costs that are crippling small, rural businesses and households in Eshowe, KwaZu lu-Natal, by launching an online grocery business. Established in 2020, Kuloola, which is derived from the Zulu word Kulula ('it’s easy'), delivers groceries to the doorsteps of rural homes and spaza shops in Eshowe. Kuloola operates through WhatsApp, SMS, Please Call Me and online. Grocery orders are packed and delivered by local third-party delivery agents within 24 hours, at a fee of R40, which is up to three times less than what customers typically pay for transport. According to Mthethwa, villagers had to travel more than 40km to town. Rural spaza shop owners, including his grandmother, were hard hit by the rising fuel costs as they stock twice a week. In 2019, he bought a bakkie and started operating. His customer base incre-ased, which prompted him to formalise it and seek funding. “I received private funding of R1 million, which helped me to get three delivery vans and a small warehouse where we operate our call centre in Eshowe. The call cen-tre is a critical component of our business because people do not have internet access here and they do not have airtime in most cases. They can simply send a ‘Please Call Me’ and we will respond,” he says.Kuloola has since added seven vans to its fleet and now employs 22 permanent employees. Mthethwa provides delivery services to over 2 000 customers each month, the majority of whom are owners of spaza shops. Young people with smartphones also have opportunities to work as ambassadors to recruit customers from their villages and earn commis -sion. Mthethwa says he is earmarking the next town, Empangeni, to offer the same services. He says he has partnered with supermarkets that prepare orders instead of using his warehouse. “After the July 2021 looting and persistent fuel hikes, the demand for our services has increased. There is now a demand for other items like appliances that we need to take into account,” he says.Mthethwa’s plan is to grow the business across the province as a solution to escalating fuel costs. He also plans to add long-distance services from the city to rural areas.
Kgaogelo Letsebe Sonia Malinga (23) from Piet Retief in Mpumalanga says being a Shoprite Group bursary recipient has ensured a promising future for her. Malinga received the bursary from the South African retailer in 2018. She applied for the bursary after finishing high school at Hoërskool Piet Retief. “Growing up, I initially wanted to be a doctor, but later I started exploring other options. I read about supply chain and logistics management and was almost instantly attracted to it. I remember I used to sit and watch the trucks drive in and out of my hometown and wonder who was ensuring that the quality and quantity of goods were correct and that they arrived at the correct delivery point. That’s when I found my passion,” says Malinga. Malinga obtained a BCom Honours degree in Logistics Management at the University of Johan-nesburg and started her career with Shoprite as a distribution centre trainee manager in February 2021. She was recently promoted to store replenishment analyst.  Being part of the Shoprite Group has broadened Malinga’s knowledge of the retail industry. “It has taught me even more about logistics management and enabled me to continuously develop my skills and advance in my career,” she says.
