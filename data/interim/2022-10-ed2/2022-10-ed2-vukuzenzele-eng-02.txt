Vuk’uzenzele4October 2022 Edition 2 HEALTHThe burden of depression in people with albinismKgaogelo LetsebeMfundo Mxolisi Ngwenya (30) from Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, is one of the few black stem cell donors in the country.The South African Bone Marrow Registry (SABMR) says more people of colour need to register as donors because a patient has the best chance of finding a match in their ethnic grouping. According to the registry, only 10% of the 78 000 registered donors are black, while 9.9% are Indian/Asian and 67% are white. The SABMR says most donors donate through a process called peripheral blood stem cell collection. It says the same stem cells found in your bone marrow are also found in your circulating blood. A non-surgical, outpatient procedure is done to collect these cells. Blood is removed through a needle in one arm, passed through a machine that collects stem cells and returned through a needle in your other arm. Stem cells are important to cure blood diseases such as leukaemia, marrow failure or aplasia. Ngwenya, a sports manager at the Durban University of Technology, says he first learnt about stem cell donation in 2012 when the SABMR held a roadshow at a local complex. “I have always donated blood and am always eager to help, so I went for it. It was really easy because they just took a swab in the mouth and said I should expect a call.” The sample taken from a potential donor’s mouth is tested and their details are stored so that they can be contacted if they become a match for someone in need of stem cells.“Last year, I received a call that they had found a perfect match. The process to donate is quite lengthy and involves about 13 different tests, ranging from a physical [to check overall health] to blood tests. I also had to inject myself on a daily basis,” he says. The actual donation takes between six and eight hours.More donors neededNgwenya says people need to be made aware that the donation process does not involve surgery. He says in some cases, cultural beliefs may stop people from beco-ming donors.The SABMR says it will be engaging traditional and religious leaders to promote stem cell donation. It says the more black people come forward, the more lives can be saved.

Severe cases of depression can lead to suicide, which the World Health Organisation lists as the fourth leading cause of death for people aged between 15 and 29. Sabelo Gumede, a psychologist based in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, believes that people with albinism need all the care and support they can get – and that starts with changing society’s understanding of what albinism is. People with this genetic condition lack melanin, which leads to a lack of colour pigmentation in the skin, hair and eyes. They battle with their vision and are at risk of developing skin cancer.Gumede says the main causes of mental health difficulties in people with albinism are discrimina tion and bullying. If not addressed, this can lead to psychological difficulties, such as depression, anxiety attacks and episodes of post-traumatic stress disorder. “People living with albinism often feel isolated, especially as a direct result of social stigmatisation. This tends to be more prevalent in townships and rural areas.” Signs of depression are isolation, poor inter-personal relationships, poor hygiene, a lack of concentration, slowness and suicidal thoughts. Combatting  depressionGumede says people with albinism can seek help from a private psychologist, ask their local clinic for help or reach out to an organisation that assists people with depression.Since people with albinism live within the community, just like everyone else, friends and family should keep an eye on them and ensure they get professional help if needed. Government and non-governmental organisations can play a crucial role in combating hate and discrimination against people with albinism through awareness and education campaigns, particularly in rural areas, because that is where violence against people with albinism is often reported.
