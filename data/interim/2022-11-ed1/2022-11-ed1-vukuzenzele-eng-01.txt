Founded in Limpopo over 20 years ago, the TVEP operates in Tshilidzini and Donald Fraser hospitals under the Thulamela Local Municipality. Its Acting Director Fhatuwani Manthada says the programme aims to instil a zero-tolerance attitude towards sexual assault, GBV and child abuse among Thohoyandou resi-dents, given the fact that these cases are prevalent in the area. He says in the past, crime statistics indicated that there were many rape cases in Tho-hoyandou, but the TVEP has made great strides in raising awareness and providing trauma counselling services to curb the scourge. As the world will be obser-ving the 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children from 25 November to 10 December, Manthada says the programme is satisfied with the progress made with encouraging residents to understand their rights and report crimes. “The TVEP receives between 80 and 100 victims of domestic violence every month, while 45 to 50 rape cases are reported monthly,” says Manthada.The programme’s one-stop centres offer a wide range of services to victims, including access to legal assistance, protection of victims against perpetrators, court case monitoring, counselling and empowerment through skills development, thus giving the victims a fresh start. Manthada states that the TVEP works closely with the South African Police Service, Toilet paper business leaves man blushing with prideCont. on page 2

The TVEP accommodates victims for up to 14 days, however, the arrangement could be extended in cases that involve the whole family or children.“We have empowerment unity that conducts public dialogues and educates people about their rights. We serve more than one million residents from Thohoyandou and surrounding areas. We have managed to restore hope and people now have trust in the criminal justice [system]  through our relationship with the police,” he says. The TVEP has also created employment for 44 people who serve in various departments such as finance, human resources and evaluation.Despite receiving continuous funding of R90 000 quarterly from the Limpopo Department of Social Development, the TVEP was affected by COVID-19 as many funders pulled out, thus negatively affecting the organisation’s operational processes.However, the Gender-Based Violence and Femicide (GBVF) Response Fund, which was launched by President Cyril Ramaphosa, together with the International Women’s Forum of South Africa and social partners have assisted the programme. The TVEP was among the first batch of the organisations, that fight against GBVF, to receive funding. With the sum of R128 million that was raised through contributions by the private sector, multi-sectoral fund, the GBVF Fund will assist and support the implementation of the National Strategic Plan on GBVF. The TVEP has been allocated R250 000 for the current year and will receive more funding for 2023.Manthada says the funds have enabled the TVEP to reach out to more victims and keep the organisation running. Murendeni Vhengani (26) is a survivor who was rescued by the TVEP from her abusive ex-boyfriend. She spent 46 months months at the centre, with her four-year-old daughter.  The centre assisted her to open charges against him and to file a protection order. He is still on trial.“They welcomed me with warm hands after many years of suffering. I felt safe. I have regained my confidence,” she says.  The GBVF Fund chairperson, Dr Judy Dlamini, says funding for 108 organisations whose applications have been successful are being processed.Information regarding the next round of applications will soon be available on the GBVF Fund website: https://gbvf.org.za/. vFrom page 1NSFAS 2023 applications openThe National Stu dent Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) 2023 application cycle has opened.Higher Education, Science and Innovation Minister Dr Blade Nzimande made the announcement recently during a media briefing.Minister Nzimande says the scheme resolved to open the application cycle early, as opposed to the previous year, in order to give prospective applicants enough time to submit their applications and supporting documents.Giving an update report on NSFAS funding for the 2022 academic year, Minister Nzimande says a budget of R43 billion was allocated to the scheme towards the beneficiaries’ tuition fees, including food and travelling allowance, and study material.He says 985 672 applications were received with 140 636 application unsuccessful.Of the applications received, 739 526 applications were provisionally approved for funding pending registration from respective institutions.“[The] majority of unsuccessful applicants failed to provide sufficient evidence to support their applications for funding; exceeded the financial eligibility threshold; already achieved the highest level of qualification that NSFAS funds and being non-compliant to the academic pathways of the TVET college sector,” Minister Nzimande explains.
According to information on the NSFAS website, as of the 2021 academic year, NSFAS no longer provides funding for postgraduate courses. This includes postgraduate certificates, postgraduate diplomas, honours degrees, masters and PhD degrees.This means the highest qualification that the scheme funds is a Bachelor’s Degree.Improving the application systemIn a bid to improve its appli cation system and process to simplify it for prospective applicants, Minister Nzimande says this year, NSFAS has implemented a number of enhancements to the system to ensure a seamless application experience.He says the NSFAS online application portal was re-designed to be more user friendly and closer to other platforms that prospective applicants are accustomed to such as WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.“The application process itself has been simplified and the questions asked are easier to understand by the public. Additionally, applicants can pause the process and continue at a later stage without restarting from scratch, something that was not possible in previous cycles, he says.“Over and above the enhancements, NSFAS developed additional chan-nels of application to cater for applicants from diverse backgrounds, also keeping in mind that most of the prospective applicants are young people who embrace the digital way of doing things,” Minister Nzimande adds.The new channels include a mobile App, USSD and WhatsApp where one can apply for NSFAS funding, track application status and cancel applications, amongst other things. This was previously done via the web portal.Furthermore, to ensure that no applicant is left behind, Minister Nzimande says NSFAS will embark on an outreach campaign to ensure that individuals who do not have access to technological devices that enable them to apply online are given the necessary resources and support to apply.
