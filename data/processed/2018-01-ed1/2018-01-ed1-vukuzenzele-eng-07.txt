2018 Central Application Clearing House (CACH)

What is the Central Application Clearing House?

The Central Application Clearing House (CACH) was created by the Department of Higher Education and Training to assist prospective students who want to enter the Post-School Education and Training (PSET) System but might be facing a situation whereby they:
Applied on time to their institution of choice but their application was declined and now it is too late to apply elsewhere.
Did not apply because they did not meet the entry requirement based on their Grade 11 results but find that their Grade 12 results meet the entry requirements.
Did not apply on time for one reason or the other or did not apply at all.
Have no clue what to study after completing matric.
Have an idea what to study but are not sure if their choice of study is right for them.

The CACH service starts on 3 January 2018, shortly before the NSC examination results are released, and will operate until the end of
February 2018.

How does CACH work?
Phase 1: Students who have not received an offer of a space by the institutions they have applied for, or who are looking for PSET learning opportunities, can contact CACH via a toll free number (call 0800 356 635), the website (www.dhet.gov. za) or via a standard SMS (SMS name and ID to 49200) or they can register online.

Phase 2: The agents will call a prospective student back free of charge, from the contact centre and register all requested details on the CACH database, indicating the learner’s chosen field of study and the province they wish to study in.

Phase 3: The applicant’s personal details and matric results will be verified and automatically transferred to institutions of higher learning for possible admission and placement.
Phase 4: The CACH service will verify
the learner’s information and forward it to institutions that still have available places. Where places exist and applicants meet the requirements, institutions will contact applicants directly to offer them available places.

Points to note
CACH cannot guarantee any applicant a space to study.
CACH cannot determine when the institutions will contact the applicant for possible placement.
