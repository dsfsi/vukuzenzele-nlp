Vuk’uzenzele4Mandulo 2022 Ushicilelo 2  EZEMPILOQaphela izimpawu zokuqala More MatshedisoUkuswela ulwazi ngomdlavuza ebantwaneni nezimpawu zawo kusho ukuthi abantwana abaningi eNingizimu Afrika bahlo nzwa ngalesi sifo uma sesihambe kakhulu.
Uma umdlavuza uhlo nzwe kusenesikhathi futhi welashwa, maningi amathuba okwelulama ngokugcwele.
UMxhumanisi weNhlangano Yomdlavuza Wabantwana eNingizimu Afrika (i-CHOC) u-Taryn Seegers uthi ukwazi izimpawu ezejwayelekile zomdlavuza kubantu abasebasha, kungasindisa impilo.
“Izimpawu nezinkomba kungaba nzima uku zihlukanisa kumaqhubu ajwayelekile, imihuzuko, ukukhula ngesivinini kanye nokuguquguquka kwemizwa. Kodwa-ke, ukuhlonzwa kusenesikha thi kungumongo,” kusho yena.
Ngokusho kweNhlangano Yomdlavuza eNingi zimu Afrika (i-CANSA), abantwana abaphakathi kwama-800 kuya kwa bayi-1 000 eNingizimu Afrika bahlonzwa ngo mdlavuza unyaka no nyaka.
Kodwa-ke, inhlangano le ingathekisa ukuthi isigamu sabantwana abanomdla vuza eNingizimu Afrika abahlonzwa nhlobo.
Ukusiza ukuqinisekisa ukuthi umdlavuza ubo nakala kusenesikhathi, i-CHOC iqhuba izinhlelo zokuqwashisa ngalesi sifo emiphakathini, ifundisa  abazali nabantwana ngezimpawu zokuqala okumele baziqaphele.
Inhlangano yeseka abantwana kanye nentsha enomdlavuza noma isifo esiyingozi segazi kanye nemindeni yabo.
“Sihlose ukwenza ngcono ukushesha ukutholaka la kwalesi sifo kanye nokulawula ukwelashwa okuyimpumelelo. Noma ngasiphi isikhathi, i-CHOC ingaba nabantwana kanye nentsha eyinakekelayo engaphezu kwe-1 500, ngesikhathi inikezela ukwesekelwa kokululekwa ngengqondo kwimindeni engaphezu kwe-1 500,” kusho u-Seegers.
Kunyaka-mali owe dlule, u-Seegers uthi i-CHOC yakwazi ukusiza abantwana abayi-1 724, intsha engama-553 kanye nabadala abayizi-2 232 ngezinhlelo zabo ezingu mongo.“Usizo lwethu luba ndakanya ukweseka ngokozwelo kulolu hambo lomdlavuza, ukududuza, ukunakekelwa uma ushona kanye nokwesekwa uma ushonelwe,” kusho u-See gers.

“Intsha, ematasa ngeze midlalo kanye nokunye ukuzivocavoca, ijwayele ukungaziqapheli izimpawu zokuqala zomdlavuza,” kusho u-Seegers.  vzomdlavuza ebantwaneniNgemininingwane ethe xaxa, shayela inombono yosizo yakwa-CHOC ku:  0800 333 555 noma uvakashele ku:  www.choc.org.za Owen MngadiAfter witnessing how being blind affected her grandmother, a young girl vowed that she would one day help people in her community with vision problems.
Manare Matlou made good on her promise and today, at the young age of 23, has an optometry practice, Optic iCare Opto metrists, in Giyani, which she opened in February 2022.
The daughter of pastors, Matlou was raised in GaPhadi in Limpopo. After matriculating from a local high school, she earned her Bachelor of Optometry degree from the Univer sity of Limpopo in 2020, at the age of 21. She then worked for several practi ces to gain experience and knowledge of running a practice.
Matlou says many people in her rural village live with vision problems and blindness because they cannot afford eye surgery.
She says the extreme heat in the area contributes to people getting cataracts and light sensitivity eye diseases.
Because of the need for better eye care in the community, she chose to open her practice in Giyani. “You need to have business knowledge to start a private practice and you must learn from col leagues in the industry.”Matlou says opening an optometry practice is expensive, because of the cost of the equipment and spectacle frames needed.
She also had to hire two assistants. As soon as her business is better establis hed, she wants to open more practices and offer pensioner discounts.
 Look after your eyesEye Care Awareness Month, which runs from September 21 to Octo ber 18, aims to educate people on the importance of eye health and regu lar screenings to avoid future complications. The Department of Health recommends that you have your eyes tested every one to two years. If you have risk factors such as high blood pressure and diabetes, it is best to do it every year.
Matlou adds that a wellbalanced diet, including nutrients like omega-3 fatty acids, lutein, zinc, and vitamins C and E, helps combat age-related vision problems. She also recommends people wear sunglasses to protect their eyes from the sun’s ultra violet rays.
She also said that Opto metrists offer primary eye care. They are trained to detect vision problems, eye diseases and other abnormalities. If needed, they supply glasses. If specialist care is needed, optometrists refer their patients to the right  specialist. vMatlou keeps an eye on her community’s visionPeople wanting to study for an optometry degree at university level need to have done english, mathe matics, physical sciences and life sciences at grade 12. It takes a minimum of four years to complete, and a one-year internship is compulsory.
