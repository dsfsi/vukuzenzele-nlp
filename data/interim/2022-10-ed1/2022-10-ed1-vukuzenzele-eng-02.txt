Vuk’uzenzele2October 2022 Edition 1Pregnant women have the responsi-bility to not drink because alcohol can cause a condition that affects a baby’s development.This is according to the Deputy Minister of Social Development, Hendrietta Bogopane-Zulu, who recently launched the 9-9-9 Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) advocacy programme.The aim of the initiative is to encourage communities to help protect unborn babies by educating people, especially women of childbearing age, about the dangers of drinking alcohol while pregnant or breastfee-ding.“It is important for all women who are pregnant and those who wish to give birth to healthy babies to avoid alcohol. The damage caused by FASD is perma-nent and irreversible, and children born with this condition have physical and intellectual problems,” said Deputy Minister Bogopane-Zulu at the launch.She added that South Africa is known to have a drinking problem, with the country ranking among the worst in the world for its levels of alcohol consump-tion.Deputy Minister Bogo-pane-Zulu recently visited different parts of the coun-try, educating women about the dangers of drinking alcohol while pregnant as part of the 9-9-9 FASD campaign.When she was in Boi-tekong in Rustenburg in the North West, she told residents that the levels of alcohol abuse in the town-ship are alarming.A four-month pregnant woman and resident of Boi-tekong, Basetsana Tlalang (28), who attended one of the campaigns, said she stopped drinking alcohol entirely after learning she was pregnant and said she is attending antenatal and information sessions at the clinic. She urged other preg-nant women to immediately stop drinking alcohol and doing drugs.The Deputy Minister warned that there is no specific treatment for alcohol-related disorders – the only way to prevent them is to avoid alcoholic beverages during preg-nancy. She encouraged pregnant women who struggle with not being able to stop drinking to visit their nearest clinic to receive assistance. – SAnews.gov.zaTel: 012 473 0353  Email: vukuzenzele@gcis.gov.zaAddress: Private Bag X745,  Pretoria, 0001Head of Editorial and Production Regomoditswe Mavimbela Regomoditswe@gcis.gov.za Acting Editor-in-Chief Zanele Mngadi | Zanelemngadi@gcis.gov.zaActing Managing Editor Tendai Gonese | tendai@gcis.gov.za News EditorNoluthando Motswai Writers: More Matshediso Ursula GraaffGraphic Designers  Tendai Gonese | Benny KubjanaProduction AssistantsJauhara Khan | Sebastion Palmer Language Practitioners  Nomgcibelo Motha  | Boitumelo PhalatseThandolunye Khulu | Mahanyele Ramapalais published by Government Communications (GCIS)Vuk’uzenzeleThe material in this publication may be reproduced, distributed, or transmitted in any form or by any means, including photocopying, recording, or other electronic or mechanical methods, without the prior permission of the publisher on condition that this publication shall be credited as the source.Distributed by: Printed by:GENERALN3 with more lanes in each direction. It also includes changing some of the major interchanges to improve traffic flow.The affected section of the N3 has over the years experienced traffic congestion, particularly during peak hours because the majority of cargo trucks from the Durban harbour use the highway to Gauteng and other inland provinces. Some of the cargo truck drivers have caused accidents by not taking care on sharp curves.“Apart from resolving chronic traffic by creating greater mobility through the construction of additional traffic lanes, the upgrading of the N3 will result in increased safety. Dangerous curves will be ironed out. Unsafe intersections will be redesigned,” Maketane says.Sanral awarded three contracts in the last quarter of 2021, and construction work began between January and April. The sections currently being upgraded are the 19 kilometre (km) stretch from Cato Ridge to Dardanelles, commonly known as Umlaas Road; the 26.6 km section from the Dardanelles Interchange to Lynnfield Park; and the 30 km stretch from Lynnfield Park to the Ashburton Interchange. Matekane explains that SIP2 will strengthen the logistics and transport corridor between South Africa’s main industrial hubs, improve access to Durban’s export and import facilities and raise efficiency along the corridor.  He adds that the project is part of the National Development Plan 2030 and National Transport Master Plan 2050 and supports government’s Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan.To this end, government intends to develop a transport system that is consistent with the real needs of the people living in South Africa and caters for people with less money to spend on travel.Maketane says the upgrades will take between eight and 10 years to complete and road closures will be kept to the minimum. He adds that motorists will be kept informed of traffic delays and the KwaZulu-Natal traffic authorities will help maintain traffic control.Sanral appeals to motorists to heed all warning signs, reduce their speed when approaching a construction site and to have consideration for other road users . vFrom page 1Fun factTransport Month is commemorated in October. This month, the Department of Transport and its enti-ties, such as Sanral, will highlight their projects and pro-grammes in the areas of aviation, maritime, public transportation and roads.
