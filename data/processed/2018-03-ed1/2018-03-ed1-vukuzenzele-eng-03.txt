The Rand West City Local Municipality is changing the face of Randfontein through the Mantrose Mega City Project, which will see thousands of houses being built for locals and will bring various job oppor-tunities to communitymembers. The recently launched R11 billion project includes the building of a mall, clinic, railway line and other amenities in Middelvlei, which will ensure job creation and boost investor confidence in the area. Rand West City Local Municipality spokesperson Tshidiso Tlharipe said the project will change the face of Randfontein. “We are truly excited about this project and we know that it is going to bring about positive change for our people. “Not only are we going to build 15 000 houses, we will also provide thousands of job opportunities for our locals and that’s ultimately what we want. We want to absorb them in projects in their own town and we believe that this will uplift them as individuals,” he said. The houses will consist of RDP and low-cost units. “We have many business owners who will sub-contract in the development of this project, and locals who will do general work, such as brick laying, plastering and painting,” said Tlharipe. This will go a long way towards accommodating the less fortunate and those who earn between R3 000 and R15 000 per month. The owner and chairperson of Finsbury Middelvlei Consortium, Matshidiso Ngakane, said the project will give them an opportunity to be part of something big in their own communities. “This is the first project of its kind in Randfontein and we are thrilled as residents. The project will pro-vide much-needed job opportunities for locals for at least seven years and will see business owners able to sustain themselves as well,” said Ngakane.
