Vuk’uzenzele4USewula 2022 umGadangiso 2 ZEPILOKgaogelo LetsebeUMfundo Mxolisi Ngwenya (onemi nyaka ema-30) weDurban, KwaZulu-Natala ungomunye wabambalwa ebantwini abanzima abani kela ngamastem cell elizweni lekhethu.
I-South African Bone Marrow Registry  (i-SABMR) ithi kufuneka abantu bo mbala abanengi abazo zitlolisa njengabanikeli ngombana isigulani siba namathuba amahle woku thola umuntu okhambelana naso emhlobeni wekhabo.
Ngokutjho kwe-ofisi yamarekhodi, ebanikelini abatlolisiweko abazii-78 000, bali-10% kwaphela ababa bantu abanzima, abama-9.9% babe maNdiya/ama-Asia, bese kuthi ama khuwa abe ma-67%.
I-SABMR ithi abanikeli ngobunengi banikela ngekambiso ebizwa ngeperipheral blood stem collection .
Ithi wona amastem cell  la afumaneka emongweni aya tholakala neengazini zakho.
Amaseli lawa-ke adoswa emzimbeni womuntu ngaphandle kokumhlinza nokumlalisa esibhedlela.
Iingazi zidoswa ngenalidi emkhonweni munye, zidlu liswe emtjhinini obuthelela amastem cell begodu zibu yiselwe ngenalidi  emkhonweni wakho omunye. Amastem cell  aqakatheke khulu ekuphili seni amagulo weengazi afana ne-leukaemia , ukwehluleka kokusebenza komkantja namkha iaplasia .
UNgwenya, omphathi wezemidlalo e-Durban University of Technology, uthi wathoma ukufunda ngokunikela ngamastem cell ngonyaka wee-2012 lokha i-SABMR ibambe ihlelo lokukhambakhamba eenthabathabeni zeentolo zangekhabo. "Bengisolo nginikela ngeengazi begodu ngihlala ngilungele uku siza, nje-ke ngakwenza lokhu. Kwaba bulula khulu ngombana bavele bathatha isampula ngeswabhu nge mlonyenami bathi ngilindele umrhala."Isampula ethethwe nge mlonyeni kongaba mnikeli iyahlolwa begodu nemini ningwanabo iyabekwa khona bazakudoselwa nange ba ngatholakala bakhambelana nomunye umuntu otlhoga amastem cell .
"Ngomnyaka ophelileko, ngafowunelwa bona bathole engikhambelana naye patsi.
Ikambiso yokunikela yida nyana begodu ifaka hlangana ukuhlolwa okwenzeka pheze imihlobo eli-13, ukusuka enyameni [ukuhlolwa bona uphilile na] nokuhlolwa kweengazi.
Kwafuneka ngizijove ngama langa," uyatjho. Ukunikela ngokwakho kungathatha ama-iri asithandathu ukuya kabunane.
Kutlhogeka Abani keli NgobunengiUNgwenya uthi kufanele abantu balemukiswe bona umuntu nakanikelako akukho lapho ahlinzwa khona.  Uthi kezinye izehla kalo, isikopilo singaba siqabo ekutheni abantu babe banikeli.
I-SABMR ithi izokukhulu misana nabadosi phambili bendabuko nebezekolo uko bana bakhuthaze isitjhaba bona sinikele ngamastem cell. Ithi ukungezeleleka kwabantu abanzima abazi vezako, kungahlenga ipilo yabantu abanengi.  vUkunikela Ngamastem Cell  Kwenziwa Ngendlela Engasibuhlungu Begodu Kuhlenga Ipilo YabanengiUkuthola imini ningwana ezeleko ngokunikela ngamastem cell , vakatjhela ku: www.sabmr.co.za , namkha udosele inomboro ethi:021 447 8638 , namkha uthumele umlayezo nge-imeyili ethi: donors@sabmr.co.za The burden of depression in people with albinismPhakama Mbonambi The dehumanisation of people living with albinism, especi ally in many sub-Saharan societies, leads to severe depression – often with ter rible consequences.
Globally, depression is a serious mental health disorder that affects people from all walks of life. Severe cases of depression can lead to suicide, which the World Health Organisation lists as the fourth leading cause of death for people aged between 15 and 29.
Sabelo Gumede, a psy chologist based in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, believes that people with albinism need all the care and sup port they can get – and that starts with changing society’s understanding of what albinism is. People with this genetic condition lack melanin, which leads to a lack of colour pigmentation in the skin, hair and eyes.
They battle with their vision and are at risk of developing skin cancer.
Gumede says the main causes of mental health difficulties in people with albinism are discrimina tion and bullying. If not addressed, this can lead to psychological difficulties, such as depression, anxiety attacks and episodes of posttraumatic stress disorder.
“People living with albi nism often feel isolated, especially as a direct result of social stigmatisation. This tends to be more prevalent in townships and rural areas.” Signs of depression are isolation, poor inter-personal relationships, poor hygiene, a lack of concentration, slow ness and suicidal thoughts. Combatting  depressionGumede says people with albinism can seek help from a private psychologist, ask their local clinic for help or reach out to an organisation that assists people with depression.
Since people with albinism live within the community, just like everyone else, friends and family should keep an eye on them and ensure they get professional help if needed.
Government and nongovernmental organisations can play a crucial role in combating hate and discri mination against people with albinism through awareness and education campaigns, particularly in rural areas, because that is where violence against people with albinism is often reported.  vOFTEN ISOLATED  by their communities, many people who live with albinism suffer in silence as life becomes unbearable.
