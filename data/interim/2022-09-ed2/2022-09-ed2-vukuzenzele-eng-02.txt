Vuk’uzenzele4September 2022 Edition 2Owen MngadiAfter witnessing how being blind affected her grandmother, a young girl vowed that she would one day help people in her community with vision problems.Manare Matlou made good on her promise and today, at the young age of 23, has an optometry practice, Optic iCare Optometrists, in Giyani, which she opened in February 2022.The daughter of pastors, Matlou was raised in Ga-Phadi in Limpopo. After matriculating from a local high school, she earned her Bachelor of Optometry degree from the University of Limpopo in 2020, at the age of 21. She then worked for several practices to gain experience and knowledge of running a practice. Matlou says many people in her rural village live with vision problems and blindness because they cannot afford eye surgery. She says the extreme heat in the area contributes to people getting cataracts and light sensitivity eye diseases.Because of the need for better eye care in the community, she chose to open her practice in Giyani. “You need to have business knowledge to start a private practice and you must learn from colleagues in the industry.”Matlou says opening an optometry practice is expensive, because of the cost of the equipment and spectacle frames needed. She also had to hire two assistants. As soon as her business is better established, she wants to open more practices and offer pensioner discounts.
 Look after your eyesEye Care Awareness Month, which runs from September 21 to October 18, aims to educate people on the importance of eye health and regular screenings to avoid future complications. The Department of Health recommends that you have your eyes tested every one to two years. If you have risk factors such as high blood pressure and diabetes, it is best to do it every year.Matlou adds that a well-balanced diet, including nutrients like omega-3 fatty acids, lutein, zinc, and vitamins C and E, helps combat age-related vision problems. She also recommends people wear sunglasses to protect their eyes from the sun’s ultraviolet rays.She also said that Optometrists offer primary eye care. They are trained to detect vision problems, eye diseases and other abnormalities. If needed, they supply glasses. If specialist care is needed, optometrists refer their patients to the right specialist. vHEALTHMatlou keeps an eye on her community's visionLook out for early signs  More MatshedisoA lack of awareness of childhood cancer and its symptoms means that many South African children are diag-nosed when the disease is at an advanced stage. The earlier cancer is diagnosed and treated, the higher the chance of a full recovery. Childhood Cancer Foun-dation South Africa (CHOC) Communication Coordina-tor Taryn Seegers says by knowing the common signs of cancer in young people, you could help save a life.“The signs and symptoms can be difficult to spot amid the normal bumps, bruises, growth spurts and mood swings. However, early detection is key,” she says.According to the Cancer Association of South Africa (CANSA), between 800 to 1 000 South African children are diagnosed with cancer each year.However, the association estimates that half of the children with cancer in South Africa are never diagnosed. To help ensure cancer is spotted as soon as possible, CHOC runs awareness pro-grammes in communities, telling parents and children about the early warning signs they must look out for. The foundation supports children and teenagers with cancer or life-threatening blood disorders and their families.“We aim to improve early detection and facilitate effective treatment. At any one time, CHOC can have over 1 500 children and teenagers in its care, while offering psycho-social sup-port to over 1 500 families,” says Seegers. In the past financial year, Seegers says CHOC was able to serve 1 724 children, 553 teenagers and 2 232 adults through its core programmes. “Our services include emotional support through their cancer journey, com-fort, end-of-life care and bereavement support,” says Seegers.
