Hlakubele 2020 Kgatiso 1 Etsa meralo  ya ditjhelete  e hlwahlwa *Ngaka Rufaro MuchekaSelemo se setjha ke monyetla wa ho qala botjha, ho theha merero e kgabane, ho tla ka ditlwaelo tse ntjha le ho lokisa ditlwaelo tse fetileng tsa ho sebedisa tjhelete ho netefatsa bokamoso bo hlwahlwa ba moshwelella. Maemo a moruo a selemo sa 2020 a shebahala eka a tla ba boima ho feta a selemo sa 2019, kahoo ho bohlokwa hore o shebe ditjhelete tsa hao ka thata le ka kelello e bulehileng. Ho fihlella boikemelo ba ditjhelete ke sepheo se tsotehang, empa ke feela batho ba mmalwa ba tsebang hore ba qala kae. Ho ba le ditlwaelo tse mmalwa ka tsa ditjhelete ho tla o thusa ho lokisetsa katleho ya hao selemong se setjha.Ho netefatsa hore o fihlella merero ya hao ya ditjhelete, o ka ithuela merero e SMART bakeng sa bokamoso bo tsitsitseng ho tsa ditjhelete. Sena se bolela ho teka merero e:
•  Tsitsitseng• Methehang• Fihlellehang •  Kgemang•  Behetsweng Nako Hodima moo, ho bohlokwa hore o etse meralo ya hao ya ditjhelete ka hloko. Maele ke ana a ka o thusang tseleng ya hao:Teka merero ya hao ya ditjhelete – Lekola boitshwaro ba hao ho tsa ditjhelete ba selemo sa 2019 mme o teke merero e metjha bakeng sa selemo sa 2020.Lefa dikoloto tsa hao – Sebedisa tjhelete ya masalla, dibonase kapa ya kekeletso ya mokgolo mabapi le ho tlosa dikoloto, kaha ho lefa dikoloto ka pele ho ka o bolokela tjhelete e ngata ya tswala.Lokisa ditekanyetso tsa hao ka tsela e hlokehang – Ha o ntse o behile leihlo hodima ditlwaelo tsa hao tsa ho sebedisa tjhelete, etsa ditokiso tse hlokehang ditekanyetsong tsa hao, eketsa dipolokeho tsa hao mme o fokotse ditshenyehelo. Haeba o thola kekeletso ya mokgolo, abela e nngwe dipolokelong ho e na le ho phahamisa tsela ya bophelo ya ditshenyehelo.Lekola dipholisi tsa inshorense botjha – Hlahloba inshorense ya bophelo ba hao, ya boitekanelo, ya boqhwala le ya nako e kgutshwane ho netefatsa hore ditefello di nyalana le ditlhoko tsa hao. Bua ka bolokolohi le molekane wa hao ka tjhelete – Balekane ba na le mokgwa wa ho patelana dintlha tsa ditjhelete.Tshwarang dikopano tsa kgwedi ka nngwe ho tshohla ditekanyetso, merero ya lona ya ditjhelete le seo bobedi le se batlang bakeng sa bokamoso.Nkang nako ya ho aha tjhebelopele e tshwanang ya hore le batla bokamoso ba lona mmoho e be bo jwang. Fokotsang ditekanyetso tsa boithabiso – Batlanang le dintho tsa mahala, tse kang diphaka, dilaeborari le dintho tseo le ka di etsang tulong ya lona. Ho na le tsela tse ngata tsa ho ithabisa ntle le ho sebedisa tjhelete.Maele a ho o thusa ho tsitlallela moralo wa haoHo tsitlallela moralong wa hao wa ditjhelete kamehla ha ho bonolo, feela rera ho:
• Dula o hlahloba diakhaonte tsa hao tsa banka – lekola ditshenyehelo tsa hao.• itokise o tsebe hore o ka kopana le mathata.• Phema dikoloto tse sa rerwang.• Reka ka bohlale. Ipotse: Na ka nnete sena ke a se hloka? Na sena ke karolo ya meralo ya ka ya ditjhelete? • Ikopanye le moeletsi wa ditjhelete haeba o sa tsebe hore na o ka qala kae.

Learners transforming communities More Matshediso Empowervate Trust is a youth development non-profit organisation (NPO) that works in partner-ship with the Department of Basic Education (DBE) to give learners an opportunity to be-come agents of change in their communities. It runs a well-established ini-tiative called the Youth Citizens Action Programme (Y-CAP), which is a competition-based programme that encourages learners from primary and secondary schools to identi-fy challenges affecting their schools and communities and come up with solutions. Empowervate Trust Founder and Chief Executive Officer Amanda Blankfield-Koseff said the idea to establish the programme came to her while she was working for a non-gov-ernmental organisation as a marketing manager. Back then, she was respon-sible for facilitating youth dialogues to discuss problems facing communities. “I realised that young people were excited to be given a platform to talk about issues affecting their communities and to suggest solutions, but it was just a ‘talk show’ and that eventually discouraged them,” she explained. Blankfield-Koseff suggested to her boss that the programme be changed into an action pro-gramme so that it could be im-pactful, with concrete results, and was given the go-ahead to run with the project. It was decided that it would proceed as a school competition to in-centivise participation.The programme was pitched to the education department and in 2010, Y-CAP held its first competition. The pilot project was run in four provinces – the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, the Western Cape and Gauteng. Last year, 400 schools from across the country participated. Four teams from different schools including primary, sec-ondary, beginner and advanced level categories won a tablet and R5000 each for coming first place, and four teams that came second place won R2500 each. Oranje Oewer Primary School in the Northern Cape won the 2019 beginner category. The team won first prize for a waste management project to keep their school environment clean. Because Y-CAP is a partner-ship between an NPO and a government department, it won the Special Ministerial Award in the 17th Public Sector Innovation Awards 2019. The DBE said partnerships with civil society are important because they are instrumental in mobilising society in support of the education of learners. It explained that while the school takes care of formal curricular education matters for children, civil society strengthens the informal co-curricular educa-tional aspects, which are es-sential for the development of a well-rounded and holistically educated child.
