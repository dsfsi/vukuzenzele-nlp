School meals contribute to learning capacity, concentration and class participation,\u201d she said.\nShe said schools that have\nbeen excluded from the pro- gramme should approach district offices if they want to come on board.\nIn the 2015/16 financial year, about R5 703 billion was allo- cated to the programme.\nRakwena said the amount spent on the programme is adjusted annually to cover inflation, and the budget for 2017/18 is around R6.4 billion.\nThe programme intends to\nalleviate short-term hunger and contribute to the well-be-ing of learners.\nSchool enrolment and learner attendance are also improving as a result of the feeding pro- gramme.\nRecently, Cabinet approved the publication of the Report on the Evaluation of the NSNP compiled by the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation (DPME). It outlines successes and steps that can be taken to improve the initiative. DPME Director for Evalua- tion Jabu Mathe, said the main aim of the evaluation was to assess whether the NSNP is being implemented in a way that is likely to result in sig- nificant health and education benefits for learners.\nHe reiterated that the overall\naim of the programme is to improve the health and nu- tritional status of the poorest learners in South Africa. The programme targets all learn- ers in quintile 1 to 3 public schools, which equates to 60 percent of the poorest schools in South Africa.\nThe programme also helps\nwith alleviating poverty in communities through job creation.\n\u201cThe evaluation found that\nthe NSNP provides opportu- nities to over 50 000 voluntary food handlers annually to cook for learners, and they earn a stipend of R960 per month,\u201d said Mathe.\n\u201cThis translates to R576 mil- lion a year in stipends which benefit community members.\u201d The programme also stim- ulates economic activity as small, medium and micro-en- terprises and co-operatives benefit as service providers in those provinces with decentralised procurement (KwaZulu-Natal, Gauteng, Mpumalanga and the North- ern Cape).\n\u201cLocal sourcing of vegetables\nhas the potential to benefit schools and communities and stimulate local agriculture.\u201d The report also revealed that the Western Cape, Mpuma- langa, Gauteng, Eastern Cape, Northern Cape and North West provinces have best implemented the programme over the years.", "edition": "2018-01-ed1", "language_code": "eng"}

I have always been a fighter and martial arts was one of my favourite sports. \"Being raped by \u2018a friend\u2019, in a situation where I couldn't fight back, was a huge knock to my self-confidence. It took a long time for me to realise that it was not my fault.\n\u201cThe initial impact was\nfear, shame and guilt. When I found my voice, I was in- spired to change the way we socialise our children and create awareness around the issues of victim blaming and our attitudes towards female sexuality,\u201d said Karmilla.

She wore all black and was quiet and withdrawn. \u201cI made myself invisible so that no one would pay attention to me and sin- gle me out.

After trying therapy, which didn\u2019t work, Karmilla moved out. Soon af- ter, she met her husband and the next stage of her recovery began. \u201cHe respected me and was the first man I talked to about the rape. Later, preg- nancy and childbirth had a profound impact on my atti- tude towards sex. It became a physical expression of love and was extremely healing.\u201d Finding her voice Karmilla got involved with Slutwalk Johannesburg and did her first Slutwalk in 2011. SlutWalk is a protest march calling for an end to rape cul- ture, including victim blaming and shaming of sexual assault victims. \u201cI finally let go of the guilt and shame and felt com- pletely healed.

{"title": "Child abuse, recognise the signs\n", "author": "Allison Cooper\n", "text": "\u201cFailure to do so is a crim- inal office,\u201d said Teddy Bear Foundation director, Dr Sha- heda Omar.\nThe foundation provides holistic, integrated and comprehensive services to victims of child abuse and their families.\n\u201cAbuse has to be reported, even if it\u2019s just a suspicion, as long as you are acting in good faith. If the allegation is unfounded, the person reporting the matter will not be subjected to any legal recourse according to a precedent set by law,\u201d Dr Omar explained.\nAccording to the World\nHealth Organisation, there are various forms of child abuse, including physi- cal,  sexual,  emotional  or\npsychological, neglect and exploitation.\nIf you suspect that a child is being abused, there are signs to look for. One of the most common signs of physical abuse is injuries that a child struggles to explain, such as \nbruises, burns or bite marks. Children who are physically abused might also flinch or back away when people raise their voices or move towards them too quickly. Signs of emotional abuse can include apathy; depres- sion; hostility or stress; lack of concentration; eating dis- orders; headaches, nausea and abdominal pains; and suicide attempts.\nSexual abuse is the most difficult form of abuse to deal with. When a child discloses sexual abuse, it is very important that it be taken seriously and handled with sensitivity. Expressions of horror, disbelief or blame can be just as damaging to a child as the act itself.\n\u201cThe rule of thumb is never to look at child abuse in iso- lation, but rather in context. Look for a cluster of symp- toms,\u201d said Dr Omar.\nShe explained that the overarching signs are sud- den changes in behaviour. A quiet child, for example, may suddenly become unruly and disruptive and display signs of aggression. \u201cIf a child tells you that they are being abused, empathise with the child\u2019s pain and trauma and re- main supportive. Do not overreact and badger a child with many questions. Rather move at their pace, explain the processes that will be followed and the people that may become involved,\u201d Dr Omar said.\n", "edition": "2018-11-ed2", "language_code": "eng"}

{"title": "The legal end to a marriage\n", "author": "Dale Hes\n", "text": "A divorce is when a marriage is officially ended in a court of law. There are two types of divorce: unopposed \u2013 where both parties are in agreement that a divorce should take place; and opposed \u2013 where the parties do not agree on a divorce or its terms. Josephine Peta, Senior Legal Admin Officer at the Depart-ment of Justice and Constitu-tional Development\u2019s Office of the Family Advocate, explains that the divorce process starts when a summons is issued. \u201cA person who wants to have their marriage dissolved can get a divorce summons at a high or regional court, or they can approach an attorney to assist with the process. The spouse who starts the divorce proceedings is referred to as the plaintiff and the other spouse is the defendant,\u201d said Peta.Peta explained that the di-vorce summons must:\n\u2022 state that there is no reasonable chance of re-storing the relationship,\u2022 make provision for the division of joint belong-ings or the enforcement of the terms agreed upon in the antenuptial agree-ment signed at the begin-ning of the marriage, and\u2022 set out what arrange-ments will be made for the couple\u2019s children, such as who the child will live with. \u201cThe summons must also state that the defendant has 10 days \u2013 in the case where he or she lives in the same area as the plaintiff, or 20 days \u2013 if the parties reside in different provinces, to answer the sum-mons,\u201d Peta added. Once a case has been opened, documents are handed back to the plaintiff, who has to deliver two sets of these docu-ments to the sheriff in the area where the defendant works or lives. \u201cThe sheriff will then serve the documents personally on the defendant and issue a return of service, proving that the documents were served. Where there are children involved, the Office of the Family Advocate must be informed,\u201d Peta pointed out. After a period of 10 or 20 days, the plaintiff may enrol the divorce on the court roll. In contested divorces, the defendant must answer the summons by notice of inten-tion to defend the matter. \u201cOnce that is done, he or she must also file a plea within a specific period. A plea is a statement in which the defendant responds to the allegations in the summons.After a plea is filed, the plaintiff can also reply to the plea or file a notice of set down.\u201cThe matter will then be enrolled for trial,\u201d Peta con-cluded.\n vWhat is a default divorce?A court will grant a divorce by default if a summons has been served on the spouse and he or she does not respond within the allocated time period. It is, however, advisable to contact your spouse first because they may later attempt to set the divorce aside on the grounds that there was a good excuse for missing the deadline.\nVuk\u2019uzenzele  newspaper will be running a series of articles related to divorce. \n", "edition": "2020-01-ed1", "language_code": "eng"}

The incidence of ectopic pregnancy is approximately two percent in the general population,\u201d said Dr Mhlari.\nSigns of an ectopic pregnancyAccording to Dr Mhlari, the symptoms appear early in pregnancy.

Common symptoms include; \n\u2022 lower abdominal pain, \u2022 a missed menstrual pe-riod; \u2022 vaginal bleeding.\u201cHowever, some women have no symptoms until the fallopian tube ruptures.

Lithemba lives in Paballelo with her mother, Elizabeth Bacela, who says her child\u2019s communication skills have improved since she started at the centre last year. Elizabeth said the stimulation area has been particularly beneficial.\u201cLithemba can now indicate when she is thirsty, hungry or has wet herself.\u201dThe Oasis ECD centre is one of 10 that received new buildings from the National Lotteries Commission (NLC) as part of the commission\u2019s Legacy Project. This countrywide initiative is aligned with the National Development Plan\u2019s commitment to improving education, innovation and training, and ensuring that all children have at least two years of preschool education.The centre accommodates children who live with a variety of conditions, including autism, down syndrome, cerebral palsy and foetal alcohol syndrome. Each of the four classes at the ECD centre has 10 to 15 pupils, says Acting Chairperson of Oasis Skills Development Centre Marina Johannesen.The department contributes a subsidy of R20 per child, which covers children between the ages of two and seven and those who are 18 years of age and above. In 2015, the DSD donated a stimulation centre, computer lab and a bus to transport pupils to and from school.\u201cOnce a week, therapists from the local hospital come to the centre to assess and treat the children,\u201dsays Johannesen.

This is according to Dr Khatija Jhazbhay, who heads up the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Unit at Townhill Hospital in Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu-Natal.\nShe explained that as adults, these children could be at an increased risk of other mental conditions, such as anxiety and depression, and could also mis-use substances. ADHD and ADD affect chil-dren\u2019s academic progress and their behaviour could annoy others. Children could also be disliked, get into trouble and be prone to accidents. \u201cEach child\u2019s circumstances are unique and developing, so it\u2019s important to do a com-prehensive clinical assessment to recognise other factors that could be impacting their development, as well as the strengths that can be built on to assist them to reach their full potential,\u201d said Dr Jhazbhay.She explained that ADHD and ADD are neurodevelopmental disorders that present with behavioural difficulties, such as inattention. This shows in the form of:\n\u2022 making careless mistakes\u2022 not completing tasks\u2022 losing things\u2022 being easily distracted and forgetful Examples of hyperac-tivity or impulsiveness include:\n\u2022 fidgeting\u2022 tapping hands or feet\u2022 squirming in their seat\u2022 blurting out answers and getting up when expected to remain seated.\u201cSymptoms present in two or more settings \u2013 at home, school, with friends or relatives or dur-ing other activities \u2013 and inter-fere with social, occupational or school functioning.

{"title": "Let us work together to fix our finances \n", "author": "vukuzenzele unnamed\n", "text": " The figures make it plain that unless we act now to turn things around, there will be even more difficult times ahead.Put simply, we are spending far more than we are earning. As a result, we are borrowing more and more, and the cost of servicing that debt is rising. In fact, debt service costs are now the fastest-growing area of expenditure. We spend more on debt repayments than we do on health; only education and social devel-opment get more.This position is precarious and unsustainable.We need to make significant changes and we need to make them now.There are several reasons for the position we\u2019re now in. Our economy has not grown much over the last decade, mainly due to the 2008 global financial crisis and a decline in demand for the minerals that we export. As a result, reve-nue collection has been weak and we have had to borrow more to sustain spending on development, infrastructure and wages. At the same time, state capture and corruption has affected governance, operational effectiveness and financial sustainability at several public institutions, including state-owned enter-prises (SOEs).Efforts over the last two years to revive the economy and rebuild institutions have now been undermined by the electricity crisis, further constraining growth and placing an additional burden on public finances.Our priorities in this budget therefore are to put the econo-my back on a path of growth, constrain public spending and stabilise our debt.The budget is an integral part of our drive for inclusive growth, job creation, invest-ment and a capable state.We have made a deliberate decision not to pursue a path of austerity. Such a route would have seen deep cuts in spending on the social servic-es that poor people rely on. It could have involved dramat-ically reducing the salaries of civil servants, the size of the public service, cutting bonus-es and pensions, raising taxes and selling off key state assets.An austerity budget would have damaged our growth prospects further and weak-ened the ability of the state to stimulate economic activity and meet people\u2019s needs.We have instead presented a budget that contains a range of balanced and well-con-sidered measures to contain spending, increase revenue and encourage growth.Over the next three years, we expect to achieve savings of around R261 billion by cutting the budgets of several depart-ments and reducing the rate at which the public service wage bill increases. At the same time, however, we will need to spend more to support the restructuring of SOEs like Eskom and SAA. As a result, we expect a net reduction of R156 billion in non-interest spending over the medium term.This will help to narrow the deficit and reduce our bor-rowing needs.A large part of the savings will come from reducing the rate at which our wage bill grows. This will require fo-cused discussions among all social partners, but particular-ly with public sector unions. These engagements need to be conducted in a spirit of seeking solutions. I am heart-ened by the willingness of all parties to engage in serious negotiations aimed at finding a solution.Our approach is not to dra-matically cut the size of the public service, but to examine the rate at which wages grow. Public service wages have on average increased at a much higher rate than inflation over many years, and we need to fix this if we are to get public finances under control. This also applies to the manage-ment of people\u2019s personal finances, where if any ex-penditure item that rises at a rate more than inflation \u2013 be it electricity tariffs, mobile tariffs or food \u2013 will always put any individual person\u2019s budget and finances under strain and out of kilter.The wage bill remains the largest component of spend-ing by economic classification. Growth in the wage bill has begun crowding out spending on capital projects for future growth and items that are critical for service delivery.The public service wage bill is by no means the only area where we are cutting costs. I have decided that there will be no increase in the salaries of senior public office bearers this year. This follows a re-duction in benefits stemming from changes to the Min-isterial Handbook. We will publish a new law this year introducing a remuneration framework for public entities and state owned companies to prevent excessive pay for board members and execu-tives.Our trade union compatri-ots are right in saying that we should in a demonstrable way prevent leakages of public funds by addressing corruption, ending irregu-lar, fruitless and wasteful expenditure. We will do this and much more.As much as containing the public wage bill is critical to stabilising public finances, improving public sector per-formance is imperative if we want to build a more capable, efficient state. We need more of the right people in the right positions.As we contain public spend-ing, we are pursuing growth. It is for this reason that, despite the fiscal gap, there are no major tax increases. Instead, there is some relief for individual tax payers and several measures to broaden the corporate tax base. We are also pushing ahead with far-reaching reforms in areas like electricity provision, ports and rail and telecommu-nications to reduce the cost of doing business. Through the Infrastructure Fund we aim to mobilise financing from a range of sources to invest in a massive build programme. Through our industrial strat-egy and investment drive we are unlocking vital areas of growth.We are fixing our public finances to make inclusive growth and job creation pos-sible. Such times call for us to be realistic, not dogmatic. They call for cooperation, not conflict. Compromises and trade-offs will have to be made.We are all in this together, and we share a collective re-sponsibility to take the oars, to row in unison and steer our country through these stormy waters.", "edition": "2020-03-ed2", "language_code": "eng"}
{"title": "Together we can fight  the impact of COVID 19\n", "author": "vukuzenzele unnamed\n", "text": "The spread of the coronavi-rus, which causes the disease known as COVID-19, has been alarmingly swift and widescale, and is now defined as a global pandemic. It knows no geographical or territorial boundaries, has infected both young and old, and is on the rise in developed and developing countries alike. As screening and testing is scaled up, the number of infections in South Africa is expected to rise. I recently declared a national state of disaster, a measure proportionate to the severity of the threat to our people, to our society and to our economy. This will enable us to have an integrated and coordinated disaster management mechanism and to set up emergency, rapid and effective response systems. This virus will be extremely disruptive, and our priority is to safeguard the health and well-being of all South Africans. We also have to address the inevitable economic fallout. We must expect a decline in exports, a drop in tourist arrivals and a severe impact on production, business viability and job creation and retention. Cabinet is in the process of finalising a comprehensive package of interventions to mitigate the expected impact of COVID-19 on our economy. This is being done in consultation with business, labour and other relevant institutions. It was Louis Pasteur who said that fortune favours the prepared mind. South Africa is prepared, and has been so for some time. Since the outbreak was first reported we have acted to put screening and containment measures in place. Our national response has been driven by an Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) chaired and ably led by the Minister of Health, Dr Zweli Mkhize.The manner in which the IMC and the support teams have responded to this emergency has been both exemplary and reassuring, particularly in helping to quell public panic. I will be chairing a National Command Council to coordinate all aspects of our national response.South Africa has a positive track record in managing public health emergencies.We have the knowledge, the means and the expertise. Our scientists and epidemiologists are world-class.We have put a raft of emergency measures in place, and will make funding available to support their implementation.They include travel bans on visitors from high-risk countries; mandatory testing, self-isolation or quarantine for South African nationals returning from these countries; and strengthening surveillance, screening and testing at ports of entry into the Republic.Social distancing is critical if we are to contain the spread of COVID-19. Gatherings of more than 100 people are prohibited and mass celebrations of national days are cancelled. Visits to all correctional centres are being suspended for 30 days with immediate effect. Non-essential international travel for government officials has been proscribed and non-essential domestic travel discouraged.A total of 35 land ports and two sea ports will be closed, as will schools from the 18th of March until after the Easter weekend. We will soon be announcing measures with regards to universities and colleges.Next month will be Easter, a sacred period for a number of faiths and a time in which mass services and gatherings will take place. The faith community should take decisions in this regard in the best interests of the health of their congregants and the country as a whole.Hygiene control should be intensified in all sectors.Every citizen should take charge of their own safety by observing measures such as frequent hand-washing with soap or hand-sanitizers and covering their nose or mouth with a tissue or flexed elbow when coughing or sneezing.As part of our national effort the Department of Health will continue with an intensive and ongoing campaign to raise awareness about prevention, transmission and infection symptoms. I encourage all South Africans to acquaint themselves with the relevant preventative material. These measures are similar to those in other countries, and it is important we all understand that they are not punitive but a matter of public safety.One of the greatest dangers at this time is ignorance and misinformation.We should stop spreading fake and unverified news, especially on social media. This can exacerbate an already tense national mood and damage the national effort.We must also not give in to the expressions of bigotry that we have seen in other countries directed at nationals of countries from where the outbreak began or the current epicenter in Europe. This is clearly a virus that affects people of all nationalities. Let us lower the wing of compassion to those who are infected, and to those who have returned home from high-risk countries. Let us assist those in need and those more vulnerable, instead of shunning them. We will remain faithful to the values of tolerance and respect that define us as a people. On behalf of all the people of South Africa I thank the team who repatriated our compatriots from Wuhan, China, as well as the leadership and people of Limpopo who are assisting with the quarantine process.This is a difficult time.And yet it is in times of ad-versity that our strength is revealed. We will act decisively, with determination and with pur-pose. We will act as a collec-tive, for it is upon the actions of every South African that the success of our efforts depend. The Thuma Mina moment is upon us, perhaps as never before. This too shall pass. We shall overcome. We are South Africans.", "edition": "2020-04-ed1", "language_code": "eng"}
{"title": "Together we can overcome COVID-19\n", "author": "vukuzenzele unnamed\n", "text": " The 114 South Africans who were evacuated from Wuhan in China some weeks ago ended their quarantine and were reunited with their families. They have all tested negative for the virus and are in good health and good spirits. For months, they had been in lockdown, first in Wuhan for some 51 days and then in Polokwane for 14 days. They were unable to be with their loved ones, unable to leave their living quarters and uncertain about when their ordeal would end. When we add the remaining 17 days that South Africa will be under lockdown they will have been under lockdown for 82 days. It was wonderful to spend time with this diverse group of South Africans made up of all ages, languages and backgrounds. I was impressed by their resilience and courage and by their determination to remain healthy. They have come from the epicentre of the coronavirus in Wuhan in China and have seen the devastating impact this virus is wreaking on human life. It is not surprising to hear them say that they are on a mission to safe-guard the health of those around them. Now their patience and fortitude has been rewarded, because they are returning to their families. Their return home was made possible by a great many people who went to great lengths to make this repatriation operation a success. As a nation, we are extremely grateful to the Government and the people of China for taking such good care of our citizens, and for their assistance in organising their repatriation. It is significant that several of the South Africans in Wuhan were on study scholarships from the Chinese government; an act of generosity that is deeply appreciated. We are grateful too to all the people who were involved in the operation, from the SAA flight crew to the medical team to the police and soldiers who brought them home. Each and every one of them stepped forward to take responsibility for the safety and well-being of others. They were prepared to undertake a difficult and dangerous mission and to subject themselves to quarantine. And now, they all tell me, they are ready for their next mission. I wish to thank the staff and management of the Ranch Hotel in Polokwane, who took great care of the returnees. They were prepared to play their part in our national effort to overcome this disease. Everyone involved in this operation has done South Africa proud. The experience of the South Africans in Wuhan demonstrates the effectiveness \u2013 and the necessity \u2013 of a state of lockdown. It was due to the drastic actions that the Chinese government took to con tain the disease in the city of Wuhan, that all of our people were able to return uninfected and healthy. Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in the province of Hubei, had more than 50,000 infections. Now, after more than two months after stringent lockdown measures were put in place, the province has had fewer than 20 new cases in the past two weeks. The containment of the disease in Wuhan City, in Hubei Province and in other places across China required a massive and extraordinary effort. It involved drastic restrictions on daily life and is having a severe impact on the Chinese economy. Other countries that have taken similar measures are having greater success in managing the spread of the disease than countries that have been slower to respond.As the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide grows to over 700,000 and the number of deaths exceeds 33,000, we can draw lessons from these countries.It is now abundantly clear that the most effective way for a society to contain the spread of the disease is for the population to remain at home and physically isolated from each other for at least several weeks. And it is important that this lockdown and all other emergency measures are both strictly adhered to and consistently enforced. As the South Africans from Wuhan can testify, such restrictions on daily life, on movement and on ordinary human contact are extremely difficult to endure. In the South African context, a lockdown brings additional hardship and strain, and we are doing everything within our means to lessen the impact on our people. But the lesson from the South Africans in Wuhan is that a lockdown works. It shows that if we strictly observe the rules in place to stop the virus spreading, we will be able to bring infection rates down. It shows that if we cooperate with health authorities in doing what we have to do, we won\u2019t be just saving our own lives but those around us too. The story of our South African returnees from Wuhan should give us encouragement and hope in the difficult weeks that lie ahead. Their story tells us that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, that if we stay the course, that if we remain disciplined and respect the lockdown, that if we work together, we will overcome.

In order to get through this difficult time, these business owners can take advantage of a number of in terventions that govern ment has put in place to assist them.\nSMME Debt  Relief FundFollowing the announce ment of the lockdown, the Department of Small Business Development immediately made a debt relief fund available for small businesses negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. More than R500 million has been made available through the fund, which small and medium enterprises must apply for through an online application process. Here are the steps that need to be followed:1. Your business must be registered on the SMME South Africa portal. If you are not yet registered, you need to go to www.smmesa.gov.za to register. 2. Once your registration is complete, you can apply for the COVID-19 SMME Debt Relief Fund. You can find the application form on the Department of Small Business Development\u2019s website. 3. If you meet all the criteria (such as your business being tax compliant and 100 percent owned by South Africans), relief funding will be paid out to approved applicants within 12 working days. If you own a micro-enterprise, then the Small Enterprise Development Agency is available to help you to apply to the debt relief scheme. Requests for assistance must be emailed to debtrelief@seda.org.za. Solidarity  Response FundPresident Cyril Ramaphosa also announced the launch of the Solidarity Response Fund, which received a R150 million kickstart from government. The fund allows organisations and individuals to donate to the nationwide effort to support small businesses and COVID-19 response efforts. In the first two weeks of the fund, over R2 billion was donated, which will be channelled into relief efforts.\nSupport for spaza shopsGovernment has recognised the unique challenges that the pandemic poses to those working in the informal sector. In this respect, Minister for Small Business Development Khumbudzo Ntshavheni has also released support packages for people working in this sector.This includes a dedicated support scheme for spaza shops. \u201cThe spaza shop support will include dedicated networking, purchasing power and bulk purchasing through pre-selected and pre-approved wholesalers,\u201d explains the minister. This support will allow spaza shops to gain access to goods which they can sell. Minister Ntshavheni adds that the scheme will also provide credit to spaza shop owners, to allow them to access the money needed to buy stock. \u201cThis will be followed by a credit facility to enable spaza shop owners to continuously buy, even after the COVID-19 outbreak is over.\u201dThe department will also provide advice on how to successfully run their shops. \u201cWe are also supporting them with business management support because we know that there are problems in spaza shops running their businesses to be profitable,\u201d Ntshavheni says.\nHelping informal tradersGovernment is also work ing on creating a package that will provide income relief to informal traders who have lost income due to the crisis. Informal businesses also qualify for the SMME Debt Relief Fund but are required to register with the department in the same manner as other small businesses.\n", "edition": "2020-05-ed1", "language_code": "eng"}

But they are also a symp tom of a fundamental failing in our post-apartheid society. The nationwide lockdown in response to the coronavirus has gravely exarcerbated a long-standing problem.Over the past few weeks, we have been confronted with distressing images of desperate people clamouring for food parcels at distribution centres and of community protests against food shortages.We have also had to contend with allegations both disturbing and disgusting. A number of provinces have received reports that callous individuals, some of them allegedly government officials, are hoarding or selling food parcels earmarked for the needy and destitute, or diverting them to their friends and families.If there is found to be substance to these allegations we will deal with the individuals concerned harshly.With the declaration of a national state of disaster and the imposition of a nation-wide lockdown we entered uncharted waters. South Africa has never had to deal with a public health emergency of this magnitude.We had to act quickly to save lives. And we must acknowledge that in the days and weeks that have followed, the provision of support to our country\u2019s most vulnerable citizens has been slower than required, and that lapses have occurred.However, the payment of social grants has proceeded relatively smoothly, and after a number of technical challenges, the food distribution system is being streamlined.Imposing a nationwide lockdown at very short notice presented several challenges. We have had to weigh up the proportionality of the national response and the extent of restrictions we would need to impose.We ultimately chose to err on the side of caution. And as the presentation by the Ministry of Health indicated recently, enforcing a lockdown at the time we did has slowed down the rate of infection and, more importantly, bought us time to prepare for a probable surge in infections in the coming weeks and months.We had to consider the impact on an already floundering economy in both the long and short term, and the impact of this substantial disruption on the livelihoods of millions of people.We had to consider what weeks of confinement to the home would mean for the employed not paid regular salaries, for the unemployed and those seeking work, for those in casual or seasonal employment, for those in the informal sector, for the indigent and for the vulnerable.Cabinet will finalise a set of measures to respond to the impact of the lockdown on the livelihoods of our people. This has been preceded by a range of engagements with a number of stakeholders including business, labour, religious organisations, civil society and the Presidential Economic Advisory Council.The social partners have put forward a number of proposals on interventions that could address the immediate vulnerability of the poorest of the poor, most of whom rely on social assistance to survive.We will scale up welfare provision during this period to help households living below the poverty line.Even when the nation-wide lockdown is lifted, its effects will continue to be felt for some time to come.Those fortunate to have a steady income will be able to return to their jobs; but for millions of others this will be a lost month where they would otherwise have found temporary work, done business in the informal sector or saved money earned to meet their family responsibilities. Food support is a short-term emergency measure.

{"title": "Let us unite in our fight against Covid-19\n", "author": "vukuzenzele unnamed\n", "text": "When the national state of disaster was declared six weeks ago, South Africa only had 61 confirmed coronavirus infections. Despite the relatively low number, expert opinion and international experience indicated that infec tions would rise exponentially. I said that urgent and drastic measures would need to be taken.Those measures \u2013 which included a nation-wide lockdown and the closure of our borders \u2013 have proved to be effective in delaying the spread of the disease. This has been possible because most South Africans have adhered to the lockdown provisions, practising social distancing and wearing face masks. I applaud you for this and for all the other sacrifices you have made.At this stage in the progress of the pandemic, other countries had far more infections than we do. As of now \u2013 which is 46 days since we recorded our 100th coronavirus case \u2013 we have 6,783 confirmed cases. Italy, which has a similar size population to ours, had more than 140,000 cases and the United States had around 700,000 confirmed cases at the 46-day mark.But this does not mean that the danger has passed. We have not nearly reached the peak of infections in South Africa. All the scientific models show that the infection rate will continue to rise at a much faster rate in the next few months.However, the speed with which the virus spreads and the number of people who are ultimately infected will be determined by what we do now. That is why the easing of the lockdown needs to be gradual and cautious. It is for this reason that many regulations need to remain in place and why it is absolutely essential that people observe them. I know how difficult this is and I understand the concern that many of our compatriots have about how these regulations are interfering and limiting their rights. But all this is necessary. Our overriding objective is the preservation of life.Social distancing and proper hygiene are still our best and only defences in this struggle. This is what informs the regulations we have put in place for level 4 of our response. Our considerations are based on empirical evidence, scientific and economic data and international best practice. In the 1995 judgment of the Constitutional Court that out-lawed capital punishment, Jus tice Arthur Chaskalson wrote: \u201cThe rights to life and dignity are the most important of all human rights and the source of all other personal rights. By committing ourselves to a society founded on the recognition of human rights we are required to value these two rights above all others.\u201dThe regulations we have put in place are founded on that commitment to life and dignity, and which justify \u2013 in these extreme circumstances \u2013 temporary restrictions on other rights, like freedom of movement and association.In doing this, South Africa is not unlike many other countries.An estimated one-fifth of the world\u2019s population is under quarantine or nationwide lockdown, with this number growing rapidly in response to rising infections. This includes countries with substantially larger populations than ours, like India with its 1.5 billion people.Dozens of countries have imposed curfews such as the one that is now in place here. Limitations on movement are in place in a number of countries. In the UK and the French capital, Paris, public exercise is limited to certain hours and within a certain distance of one\u2019s home.Containment and prevention measures similar to ours are in place in a number of countries. For example, alcohol sales during lockdown have been either restricted or banned in a number of territories and by local governments, including parts of Mexico, Hong Kong and Greenland, which last month imposed a ban on alcohol sales during lockdown to limit infection but also \u2018to curb violence against women and children.\u2019There has been much public comment on government\u2019s decision to extend the prohibition on the sale of tobacco products into level 4. A decision like this is bound to be controversial, but it is wrong to suggest that there are Ministers or a President doing and saying whatever they want on this matter.On 23 April, I announced that cigarette sales would be permitted during level 4. This was based on the view of the National Coronavirus Command Council (NCCC), and which was contained in the draft framework that was published for consulation.After careful consideration and discussion, the NCCC reconsidered its position on tobacco. As a result, the regulations ratified by Cabinet and announced by Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma on 29 April extended the prohibition.This was a collective decision and the public statements by both myself and the Minister were done on behalf of, and mandated by, the collective I lead.Every regulation we have put in place has been carefully considered. Along the way there has been consultation with medical experts, various constituencies and different industries. We have been guided by international bodies and the experience of other countries.The reality is that we are sailing in unchartered waters. There is still a great deal about the epidemiology of the virus that is unknown. It is better to err on the side of caution than to pay the devastating price of a lapse in judgment in future. While there are differing views on some of the decisions we have taken \u2013 and in some instances these have polarised opinion \u2013 government is making every effort to act in a way that advances the rights to life and dignity of all our people.Listening to our people and their concerns during this period has been one of the distinguishing features of how we as government have managed this pandemic. We continue to listen to the concerns of our people and are prepared to make adjustments that balance people\u2019s concerns about the challenges they face with the need to save lives.At this difficult time, our collective energies must be focused on ensuring that health and life is preserved, that the delivery of food, water, health care, social security and social support is not disrupted.\nUnder these extraordinary circumstances, as government, as individuals and as society we will at times make mistakes. When these occur, we will correct them. But we must carry on, losing neither our nerve nor our resolve.The situation in which we find ourselves demands courage and patience. It requires goodwill and trust between you, the citizen, and your gov-ernment, and between each other.FROM THE UNION BUILDINGS\n  3 Vuk\u2019uzenzeleHelp for our vulnerable citizensMany countries around the world have imposed coronavirus lockdowns with a view to saving the lives of their citizens.

The face-mask must cover the nose and mouth completely. Face-masks should not be lowered when speaking, cough-ing or sneezing.\nIt is very important that cloth masks are used correctly. Incorrect use might result in users putting themselves at risk of spreading Covid-19.Even when you are wearing a mask you must still: \u2022 wash your hands \u2022 observe social distancing \u2022 remember to sneeze and cough into your elbow \u2022 avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unclean hands.The public should not use surgical (medical) or N-95 respirator masks because these are reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders. \n\nMay 2020 Edition 2How to handle your cloth mask 1. Only use a mask that has been washed and ironed.2. Wash your hands before putting the mask on.3. Place the mask with the correct side facing your face, and ensure that it covers both your nose and mouth properly.4. Tie the strings behind your head, or if you are using elastic bands, make sure these are tight.5. Make sure it fits well. Move it around to get the best fit. Never touch the cloth part.6. Once you have put on the mask, DO NOT TOUCH YOUR FACE again until you take it off.7. When you take it off, undo the ties, and carefully fold the mask inside out, hold it by the strings/elastic and place the mask in a container reserved for washing the cloth mask.8.

This practice is very important while we are in the midst of the coro navirus epidemic where the virus spreads from person to person via an infected person passing droplets through sneezing, coughing or talking.The implementation of social distancing and the lockdown in South Africa is essential in flattening the curve, which is indicated by the number of infected people dropping.\nThis information was supplied by the Department of Health", "edition": "2020-05-ed2", "language_code": "eng"}
{"title": "Our democracy will help  us overcome Covid-19 \n", "author": "vukuzenzele unnamed\n", "text": " We have among the most politically-engaged citizenry in the world. A poll in 2018 by the Pew Research Center shows South Africans are strongly inclined to take political action about issues they feel most strongly about, such as health care, education, freedom of speech and corruption. The poll confirms much that we already know about our-selves. We enjoy nothing more than robust engagement with our government and among ourselves on the burning issues of the day. We have an active civil society ever ready to safeguard our fundamental freedoms and rights.One of the triumphs of our democracy is that every South African believes the Constitu-tion protects them and that the courts are a fair and impartial arbiter of their interests.I got thinking on these mat-ters during a recent visit to the Eastern Cape to assess the province\u2019s coronavirus state of readiness.I was asked by a journalist whether I was concerned at the pending litigation challenging certain provisions of the Disas-ter Management Act. This law is the basis for all the regulations promulgated under the nation-al state of disaster we declared to combat coronavirus.Since the start of this crisis, a number of people have exer-cised their right to approach the courts. The lockdown regulations were challenged in the very first week of the lock-down by a private citizen from Mpumalanga who wanted an exemption from the travel prohibition to attend a funeral.In the seven (7) weeks that have followed, there have been legal challenges from a number of individuals, religious bodies, political parties, NGOs and from business organisations against one measure or more of the lockdown provisions they were unhappy with. Some have succeeded in their legal chal-lenges and some have not. Some had approached the courts on the basis of the urgency of their cases had their urgency argu-ments dismissed and others have found other avenues for the relief they sought. Others have subsequently withdrawn their applications following engagement with government.While we would prefer to avoid the need for any legal action against government, we should accept that citizens who are unhappy with whatever action that government has decided on implementing have a right to approach our courts for any form of relief they seek. This is a normal tenet of a constitutional democracy and a perfectly acceptable practice in a country founded on the rule of law.We have checks and balances in place to ensure that every aspect of governance is able to withstand constitutional scrutiny. Where we are found wanting, we will be held to account by our courts and, above all, by our citizens. Be-sides our courts, our Chapter 9 institutions exist to advance the rights of citizens, as do the bod-ies tasked with oversight over the law enforcement agencies.As I told the journalist, every South African has a right to ap-proach the courts and even I, as President, could never stand in the way of anybody exercising that right.There has been, and will con-tinue to be, robust and strident critique of a number of aspects of our national response to coronavirus, from the data modelling and projections, to the economic effects of the lockdown, to the regulations. As government we have nei-ther called for such critique to be tempered or for it to be silenced.To the contrary, criticism, where it is constructive, helps us to adapt and to move with agility in response to changing circumstances and conditions. It enriches public debate and gives us all a broader under-standing of the issues at play.We have consistently main-tained that we rely on scientific, economic and empirical data when it comes to making deci-sions and formulating regula-tions around our coronavirus response. To the greatest extent possible under these challeng-ing circumstances, we aim for consultation and engagement. We want all South Africans to be part of this national effort. The voices of ordinary citizens must continue to be heard at a time as critical as this.The coronavirus pandemic and the measures we have taken to combat it have taken a heavy toll on our people. It has caused huge disruption and hardship. Although we can point to the progress we have made in delaying the transmis-sion of the virus, there is still a long way to go. The weeks and months ahead will be difficult and will demand much more from our people.The pandemic will therefore continue to place an enormous strain on our society and our institutions. Even as we grad-ually open up the economy, the impact on people\u2019s material conditions will be severe. For as long as this is the case, the po-tential for conflict, discord and dissatisfaction will remain.As we navigate these turbu lent waters, our Constitution is our most important guide and our most valued protection. Our robust democracy provides the strength and the resilience we need to overcome this deep crisis.Just as government appreciates that most court appli cants are motivated by the common good, so too should we recognise that the decisions taken by government are made in good faith and are meant to advance, and not to harm, the interests of South Africans.Our foremost priority remains to save lives. Our every decision is informed by the need to advance the rights to life and dignity as set out in our Constitution.We will continue to welcome different \u2013 even dissenting \u2013 viewpoints around our na-tional coronavirus response. All viewpoints aid us and help us to work better and smarter.The exercise of the fun-damental freedoms of expression, associa-tion and speech is a barometer of the good health of our democ-racy. But much more than that, these rights are essential to the success of our na-tional and collective struggle to overcome the coronavirus.", "edition": "2020-06-ed1", "language_code": "eng"}
{"title": "Cigarette ban  will save lives\n", "author": "Silusapho Nyanda\n", "text": "COVID-19 is a respiratory virus. As such, smokers are twice as likely to suffer more serious symptoms than people who have never smoked, says Dr Catherine Egbe, a specialist scientist at the South African Medical Research Council\u2019s Alcohol, Tobacco and Other Drug Research Unit.Dr Egbe says that smoking is known to cause many of the underlying medical conditions that have been linked to severe symptoms of COVID-19. These include:\n\u2022 cancers \u2022 heart disease and stroke \u2022 asthma\u2022 diabetes. \u201cEven if smoking does not directly cause a smoker to die from COVID-19, it could cause this indirectly because smokers are more likely to have the diseases that could make a person die of the virus,\u201d she says.In addition to this, ciga-rette smoking harms nearly every organ of the body and generally reduces the body\u2019s ability to fight diseases. Dr Egbe says that tobacco smoking produces more than 7 000 chemicals; 250 of these chemicals have been confirmed to be toxic to the human body. Out of these 250 chemicals, 69 are known to cause cancer. This reduces the health of smokers as well as those exposed to second-hand smoke, Dr Egbe explains.She says that those who have TB and asthma are also high-risk patients where COVID-19 is concerned. \u201cSo far, there is evidence to show that those who have asthma are at risk of having severe symptoms or even dying if they contract COV ID-19. There is no study that has been published showing TB patients\u2019 risk but the World Health Organisation has warned that it is not unlikely that persons with TB will have poor treatment outcomes if they contract COVID-19.\u201dShe says the decision to ban the sale of cigarettes under the current lockdown level is in the interests of the people.\nSale of cigarettePresident Cyril Ramapho sa had initially announced that under Level 4, cigarette sales would be allowed but government reversed the decision after the National Coronavirus Command Council consulted with medical experts and various role-players.Dr Egbe says apart from the direct health implications of smoking, cigarettes are often shared among friends which can lead to faster community transmission of COVID-19.\u201cRemember, people are being asked to avoid touching their mouth, nose and eyes. When a person is smoking, he or she will not be able to keep to that hygiene practice,\u201d says Dr Egbe.In a country with a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, TB, substance abuse and alcoholism, among others, Dr Egbe believes that government made the right call.She says government is using the data at its disposal to take precautionary meas ures to continue to protect South Africa from experiencing the scenes witnessed in countries like Italy.\u201cIt\u2019s not a permanent ban; people must remember that,\u201d she says. Currently, South Africa has a limited number of ventilators and should the number of those needing ventilators spike during the pandemic, the country would find itself in a corner and not be able to help those who need aid.\u201cWe have a little over  3 000 ventilator s. Imagine if those above 65 years who are smokers, happen to need ventilators. We will need over 10 000 ventilators only for that group alone. That is one of the things that gov-ernment is trying to avoid. We hope that people will see this as a good reason to quit smoking,\u201d she says.\n\nDid you know?  You can call The National Council Against Smoking at 011 720 3145 to assist you to quit smoking.

{"title": "Let us protect and support our children\n", "author": "vukuzenzele unnamed\n", "text": " I want to thank the millions of parents, grandparents and caregivers around South Africa who continue to play an important role in the formative years in the lives of our youngest citizens. The encouragement, sup port and protection children receive from their parents and caregivers is essential for their future happiness and success. On 01 June the country started a new phase in its fight against the coronavirus. Many economic and social activities restarted, including a phased resumption of schooling. We have said that we are taking a gradual approach, guided by the advice of our scientists and led by the realities on the ground and consultations with stakeholders. In the last few weeks, as we have prepared to return to school, we have had extensive and detailed discussions with all role-players in the education sphere. These have guided our approach to this complex and challenging task. Several of these stakeholders \u2013 including teachers and parents \u2013 have expressed concern about the state of readiness in many schools. We have heard them, we welcome their contributions and are taking steps to address their concerns as well as proposals. It is understandable that many parents and caregivers have mixed emotions at this time about the reopening of schools. There is relief that children will be able to resume their education after a prolonged absence from classrooms and lecture halls. Young people are eager to be in school again and to see friends and teachers. But there is also apprehension on the part of parents, edu cators and learners themselves. Parents want reassurance that the necessary precautions should be in place to adequate-ly protect learners. The safety of our youngest citizens from a health and physical perspective is not negotiable. It is our foremost priority. As we prepare for the gradual re-opening of our schools and places of higher learning, education authorities have been hard at work putting the necessary health and safety measures in place. That documentation regarding standard operating procedures have been provided to all schools. These standard operating procedures cover issues like train ing and orientation of screen ers, timetable realignment and configuring classrooms to meet social distancing requirements. We are continuing with the process of delivering personal protective equipment and ensuring the availability of water and sanitation services. Learning, once it commences, will take place under strict conditions with a correctly limited number of learners and students. As parents, teachers, governing bodies and government, we are in agreement that no school should re-open until all the necessary precautions are in place. There needs to be transparency about the level of preparedness of each of the schools. Everyone who is a key role player, be they a parent, a school governing body member, a teacher or a government official should be able to have the correct information about the state of preparedness of each school. It is our collective responsibility to ensure that the learning environment is safe. I want to salute parents and caregivers, in particular, for the role they have played over the last two months. With schools closed, they have had to take greater daily responsibility for the education and development of their children. Many parents and caregivers have had to assist learners with their schoolwork at home, no doubt gaining a keen appreciation of the hard work being done by our teachers every day. Once the lockdown is lifted and more learners return to school, we parents should continue to play a more active role in the education of our children, whether it is through joining school governing bod-ies, volunteering our services at schools or other forms of assistance. Parents can join in volunteering to clean schools, establishing vegetable gardens or being part of neighbourhood school safety committees. This can turn the schools into real, meaningful \u201ccommunity schools\u201d. Though we may feel anxious and fearful as our sons and daughters leave our care, we must draw courage from the fact that every effort is being made to protect them. As parents, you have entrusted us with the welfare and safety of your children. It is a responsibility we do not take lightly. In the days and weeks to come, we will be closely monitoring the return to school. If we follow the protocols and maintain all precautions \u2013 as parents, educators, communities and learners \u2013 we will effectively minimise the risk posed by the coronavirus. Ultimately it is both our personal actions and our collective efforts that will keep our children safe. Whatever we do next, we need to do together. \n\n", "edition": "2020-06-ed2", "language_code": "eng"}

They include the following metros: City of Tshwane  City of Johannesburg  Ekurhuleni  eThekwini  Nelson Mandela Bay  Buffalo City  Cape Town.Other areas that have been identified as hotspots are the West Coast, Overberg and Cape Winelands district municipalities in the Western Cape, Chris Hani district in the Eastern Cape and iLembe district in KwaZulu-Natal.A hotspot is defined as an area that has more than five infected people per every 100 000 people or where new infections are increasing at a fast pace. To deal with the virus in these areas, government will implement intensive interventions aimed at decreasing the number of new infections.\u201cWe are putting in place enhanced measures of surveillance, infection control and management. We will assign a full-time team of experienced personnel to each hotspot,\u201d the President says.This team will include epidemiologists, family practition ers, nurses, community health workers, public health experts and emergency medical services, to be supported by Cuban experts.\u201cWe will link each hotspot to testing services, isolation facilities, quarantine facilities, treatment, hospital beds and contact tracing.\u201cShould it be necessary, any part of the country could be returned to alert levels 4 or 5 if the spread of infection is not contained despite our interventions and there is a risk of our health facilities being overwhelmed,\u201d he says.The list of hotspot areas will be reviewed every two weeks depending on the progression of the virus.\n\nOpening the economyThe implementation of alert level 3 which started at the beginning of June, involved the return to operation of most sectors of the econo my, subject to observance of strict health protocols and social distancing rules.  More public servants have also returned to work in accordance with provisions of the Occupational Health and Safety Act and as guided by the Department of Public Service and Administration, working together with all other departments in government.\nProtocols and workplace plansAs more sectors of the econ omy open, government will rely on social compacts with all key role players to address the key risk factors at the workplace and in the interface between employees and the public.\u201cWe will therefore be finalising a number of sector protocols and will require every company to develop a workplace plan before they re-open,\u201d he says.According to these plans, companies will need to put in place sanitary and social distancing measures and facilities; they will need to screen workers on arrival each day, quarantine those who may be infected and make arrangements for them to be tested.\u201cThey also need to assist with contact tracing if employees test positive. Because of their vulnerability, all staff who are older than 60 years of age and those who suffer from underlying conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease and cancer should ideally stay at home,\u201d the President says.Employees who can work from home should be allowed to do so.Subject to these measures, all manufacturing, mining, construction, financial services, professional and business services, information technology, com munications, government services and media services, reopened from 1 June. The appropriate restart and phasing in arrangements will need to be put in place for every workplace.\u201cWholesale and retail trade will be fully opened, including stores, spaza shops and informal traders. E-commerce will continue to remain open. Other sectors that opened previous ly, such as agriculture and forestry, utilities, medical services, food production and manufacture of hygiene products, will remain fully opened,\u201d he says.\nHigh-risk economic activities prohibitedHigh-risk economic activi ties will remain prohibited. These include:\n\u2022 Restaurants, bars and taverns, except for delivery or collection of food.\u2022 Accommodation and domestic air travel, except for business travel, which will be phased in on dates to be announced.\u2022 Conferences, events, entertainment and sporting activities.\u2022 Personal care services, including hairdressing and beauty services.\nMovement of people and sale of alcoholPeople will be able to exer cise at any time during the day, provided this is not done in groups. The curfew on the movement of people will be lifted.\u201cAlcohol may be sold for home consumption only under strict conditions, on specified days and for limited hours. Announcements in this regard will be made once we have concluded discussions with the sector on the various conditions,\u201d the President says.The sale of tobacco products will remain prohibited in alert level 3, due to the health risks associated with smoking.\u201cAll gatherings will remain prohibited, except for funerals with no more than 50 people or meetings in the workplace for work purposes,\u201d he says.\nExpect rise in infectionsPresident Ramaphosa says, in preparation for the expected increase in COVID-19 infections in the country, around 20 000 hospital beds have been, and are being, repurposed for COVID-19 cases, and 27 field hospitals are being built around the country. \u201cA number of these hospitals are ready to receive coronavirus patients.\u201d The President says government appreciates the work that continues to be done by public servants, especially those in the front line in the fight against COVID-19.\u201cThe safety of all workers, including public servants, is a matter of concern to us. We will continue to make all efforts for the adequate provision of personal protection equipment to ensure safety for everyone while at work.\u201cOur priority is to reduce the opportunities for the transmission of the virus and create a safe environment for everyone,\u201d he says. \nTips to follow to avoid being infected by the coronavirus disease.\n \u00bbStay at home as much as you can. \u00bbRemember to social distance. \u00bbWear your face mask. \u00bbWash your hands with soap thoroughly. Wash the back of your hands, between the fingers and under the nails. Always wash your hands with soap before you eat and after being out in public. \u00bbCover your mouth with a tissue paper when you cough and sneeze. Avoid touching your face with dirty hands at all times.  \u00bbSeek medical help if you feel unwell. Typical symptoms of COVID-19 include coughing, runny nose, fever and shortness of breath.

My symp-toms were not as severe as my husband\u2019s, who had body aches, nausea, a tight chest, shortness of breath, blocked sinuses, thick phlegm on his chest and a fever.

{"title": "SA youth are a source of inspiration and hope \n", "author": "vukuzenzele unnamed\n", "text": " No matter where they live and no matter what they do, they each have a burning desire to change the world. While they certainly want to improve their own lives, they also want to achieve a better society and a better world. They see themselves as agents for fundamental transformation. Throughout history young people have been a driving force for change. In just the last few decades, young peo-ple have waged numerous struggles against injustice, from the 1968 student upris-ing in Paris, to the anti-war movement in the United States in the 1960s, to the an-ti-colonial struggle in many African and Asian countries, to the fight against apartheid, to the Arab Spring. Most recently, young peo-ple have been at the forefront of the #BlackLivesMatter movement that has gained global support in the wake of the killing of George Floyd in the United States.Over the past few weeks, activists around the world have also been demanding the removal of symbols that glorify the barbarity and vi-olence of the slave trade and colonialism. At an Oxford University demonstration recently a protestor carried a placard with the words \u2018Rhodes must Fall\u2019, the rallying cry of students in our own country five years ago.Young people across the world have found common cause. They are tearing down statues and symbols of racism, demanding the decolonisation of educa-tional curricula, and calling for institutions to address racism and social exclusion.And so, as we paid tribute to the generation of 1976 on 16 June 2020, we also salute the youth of post-apartheid South Africa, the worthy in-heritors of this noble legacy.The mission of 1976 gener-ation was to dismantle bantu education; that of today\u2019s youth is to take forward the project of national reconcilia-tion and transformation.In time to come it will be said that this year, 2020, marked the start of a new epoch in human history.Not only has coronavirus had a momentous impact on people\u2019s lives and liveli-hoods, it has also shaken up the global social order.The manner in which the pandemic has taken hold has been a reminder of the interconnectedness of the human race and of the deep inequalities that exist be-tween countries and within countries.The pandemic presents an opportunity to \u2018reset\u2019 a world that is characterised by crass materialism, selfishness and self-absorption not just on the part of individuals but whole societies.Young people are telling us that the essential values of integrity, compassion and solidarity must be the hallmarks of the new socie-ty that will emerge, and that they are determined to be the champions of this new, better world.In the discussions I have had with young people I have said that we should never underestimate the power of an idea, because ideas can and have changed the world. Ideas have spurred human progress and they are what will enable us to chart a new path in the post-coronavirus era. These young people have turned their ideas into ac-tion. They have not let a lack of resources hinder them. They have carved a niche for themselves in a number of sectors from high-tech to environmental sustainability. Now more than ever we will look to the innovative and pioneering spirit of our youth to come up with solu-tions to the unemployment crisis that benefit them, their communities and society.At the same time, I chal-lenge our country\u2019s youth to craft and design programmes that will enable us to meet our developmental goals.In 1961, revolutionary Cuba sent legions of young student volunteers into the mountains and villages to construct schools, teach liter-acy and train new educators. It is still held up as one of the most successful literacy cam-paigns in modern history.Our young people must develop social upliftment initiatives and they must lead them.Just as they took up the struggle for equality in higher education, the consid-erable energies of our youth must also be brought to bear to fight for equitable access to health care, for the trans-formation of land ownership and, most importantly, for gender justice.Like all South Africans, I have been deeply disturbed by a surge in the murder of young women at the hands of men. These are shocking acts of inhumanity that have no place in our society.Youth-led civic activism, awareness raising and peer counselling are vital tools in our efforts to eradicate gender-based violence from society. At the same time, we must strengthen our justice system, ensuring that perpetrators are brought to book, bail and parole conditions are tightened and that those sentenced to life spend the rest of their lives behind bars.While this needs society-wide action, I call on young men in particular to take up the struggle against gender-based violence. Unless we end the war that is being waged against South African women, the dream of a new society will remain elusive.Those of us who were part of student movements during the apartheid era are often asked what we think of the young people of today. There is a temptation to retreat into nostalgia about \u2018the glory days\u2019 of student politics and youth struggle, never to be replicated.But just as the youth of yesteryear defined their mission, today\u2019s youth have defined theirs.South African youth of 2020 more than meet the high standard set by their prede-cessors. They are optimistic, resilient and courageous, of-ten in the face of the harshest of circumstances.They are a source of inspi-ration and hope. Through their actions, they are build-ing a world that is more just, equal, sustainable and at peace. Young people across the world are calling on institutions to stop racism and social exclusion.\n", "edition": "2020-07-ed1", "language_code": "eng"}

There they provide medical care, administrative support and other services like cleaning and catering. Just as they perform what is their professional duty, we too have a duty to them and to their families. Their health and their safety must be paramount. We honour them and uphold them as the men and women who have demonstrated they are prepared to risk their lives so that we may live. For them to do their Herculean work they need our support as well as protection through the provision of personal protective equipment (PPE). With the support of the Solidarity Fund and donations from many individual South Africans, businesses, foundations and other governments, we have been able to procure personal protective equipment for these brave frontline workers. Where there have been shortages of PPE our hospitals are urgently attending to ensuring that they are available. We know that access to PPE is not the only challenge our healthcare workers face. Across the country clinics and hospitals are facing staff shortages. This problem is being attended to. To support the work that our frontline workers are performing around the country we are deploying Ministers and Deputy Ministers to each of the districts in the country to get a line of sight of specific challenges in these districts and to work with provincial health authorities. We need to work together to safeguard the health of not just our frontline workers but the entire workforce. There has already been sterling work done by unions in educating members around infection control and prevention and hygiene. They are also supporting the work of the Department of Employment and Labour in conducting workplace inspections to ensure health and safety protocols are in place for returning workers. Many of our trade unions are also providing coronavirus information to their members and employers are running awareness campaigns. One of the challenges that has emerged in our country is the stigmatisation of people who have proven positive with coronavirus. As a society, we have a collective responsibility to stamp out the stig matisation of people infected with the coronavirus. There have been disturbing reports of individuals being ostracised from their communities and of communities protesting against coronavirus patients being admitted to local hospitals and clinics. This must stop. Just as we came together to promote acceptance of people living with HIV and stood firm against victimisation, we must show understanding, tolerance, kindness, empathy and compassion for those who are infected with this virus and for their families. It is said that this stigmatisation is driven by fear of con tracting the disease and lack of understanding. The best way to overcome our instinctive fear of illness and contagion is to observe the hygiene protocols that are in place. The fear of infection is well-founded and real. At the same time, we know what we have to do to protect ourselves and others. We know what causes the virus and what we can do to protect ourselves from becoming infected. We know we have to maintain social distancing, to self-isolate if we have come into contact with those infected and to present to a hospital if we have symptoms. We must continue to be guided by facts and not rumours. The time when anyone could say they do not know anyone who is infected or affected by coronavirus has long passed. Now, more than ever, our friends, families, colleagues and neighbours need our empathy and support. In the days, weeks and months that lie ahead, we will at times find ourselves despondent and fearful as we see the numbers of people infected and dying continue to rise. It may be that things have gotten worse, but we are certain that they will get better. Our scientists and medical advisers told us that the rate of infections will go up as we move towards our peak. But it will certainly come down. We pay tribute to the healthcare workers who lost their lives caring for the sick. In their memory, let us keep ourselves and our fellow citizens safe by playing our part. We shall overcome this virus and rebuild our society. We have seen darker times and we have prevailed. Let us spare neither strength nor courage as we work together to save lives.\n", "edition": "2020-07-ed2", "language_code": "eng"}

{"title": "South Africa acts to address ventilator shortage\n", "author": "Silusapho Nyanda\n", "text": "The fight against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in South Africa has been boosted with the production of the first ventilator made in the country.\nThe Continuous Positive \nAirway Pressure (CPAP) ventilator helps patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19 to breathe easier by providing a mild level of oxygenated air pressure to keep their airways open.The ventilator was de-signed by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) in collabo-ration with a number of local partners and will be rolled out nationwide to patients showing respiratory distress in the early phase of COV-ID-19 infection.\u201cThe air a person normally breaths has a 23 percent con-centration of oxygen. The CPAP ventilator can pump a higher amount of oxygen, helping a person breathe. The CPAP pumps continu-ous concentrated oxygen. You can increase or decrease the amount of oxygen one is breathing in,\u201d says Executive Manager of CSIR Future Production: Manufacturing Martin Sanne.Patients using the ventilator are connected via a face mask. Oxygen is drawn from an oxygen gas tank and is mixed with natural air in the ventilator, from where it is transmitted to the mask and breathed in by the patient. Sanne says that in addition to pumping oxygenated air, the CPAP also helps patients exhale.The CPAP device can be used in both high-tech clinical environments and temporary settings, such as field hospitals and quarantine facilities. Sanne says the CSIR will have produced 10 000 ventilators by the end of August.  Working with Siemens, Simera, Akacia, Gabler, Umoya and the University of Cape Town, the CSIR produced the CPAP according to World Health Organisation standards.The first batch of ventilators will be given to state hospitals experiencing pressure due to the unavailability of equipment to deal with COVID-19.The CSIR started working on the CPAP after the world began experiencing an extreme shortage in ventilators. \u201cAround March and April, there suddenly became a short supply of ventilators from our international suppliers. Where you could get them, they were very expensive so government issued a tender for the production of ventilators,\u201d says Sanne.The tender was part of the government\u2019s National Ventilator Project within the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition.The CSIR is also working on a Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure ventilator aimed at helping patients with more severe symptoms of COVID-19. The ventilator will assist with both inhalation and exhalation, either in fixed pressure modes or by sensing the oxygen sup-ply required by a patient and adjusting the pressure accordingly.\n \n\n\n\n", "edition": "2020-08-ed1", "language_code": "eng"}
{"title": "Help stop  the spread  of COVID-19 \n", "author": "vukuzenzele unnamed\n", "text": " But now, the surge in infec-tions that we had been advised by our medical experts would come, has arrived. More than a quarter of a million South Africans have been infected with coronavirus, and we know that many more infections have gone undetected. We are now recording over 12,000 new cas-es every day. Since the start of the outbreak in March, at least 4,079 people have died from COVID-19.  Like the massive cold fronts that sweep into our country from the South Atlantic at this time of year, there are few parts of the country that will remain untouched by the coronavirus. The coronavirus storm is far fiercer and more destructive than any we have known before. It is stretching our resources and our resolve to their limits. The surge of infections that our experts and scientists predicted over 3 months ago has now arrived. It started in the Western Cape and is now underway in the Eastern Cape and Gauteng.Yet, while infections rise expo-nentially, it is important to note that our case fatality rate of 1.5 percent is among the lowest in the world. This is compared to a global average case fatality rate of 4.4 percent. We owe the relatively low number of deaths in our country to the experience and dedication of our health professionals and the urgent measures we have taken to build the capacity of our health system. Even as most of our people have taken action to prevent the spread of the virus, there are others who have not. There are some among us who ignore the regulations that have been passed to combat the disease. In the midst of such a pan-demic, getting into a taxi with-out a face mask, gathering to meet friends, attending parties or even visiting family, can too easily spread the virus and cost lives. This may be a disease that is caused by a virus, but it is spread by human conduct and behaviour. Through our own actions \u2013 as individuals, as families, as communities \u2013 we can and we must change the course of this pandemic in our country. We need to wear a cloth mask that covers our nose and mouth whenever we leave home. We must continue to regularly wash our hands with soap and water or sanitiser. We must continue to clean and sanitise all surfaces in all public spac-es. Most importantly, we must keep a safe distance \u2013 of at least 2 metres \u2013 from other people. There is now emerging evi-dence that the virus may also be carried in tiny particles in the air in places that are crowded, closed or have poor air circulation. For this reason we must immediately improve the indoor environment of public places where the risk of infection is greatest. Our decision to declare a nation-wide lockdown pre-vented a massive early surge of infections when our health services were less prepared, which would have resulted in a far greater loss of lives. In the time that we had, we have taken important meas-ures to strengthen our health response. We have conducted more than two million coro-navirus tests and community health workers have done more than 20 million screenings. We have made available al-most 28,000 hospital beds for COVID-19 patients and have constructed functional field hospitals across the country. We now have over 37,000 quarantine beds in private and public facilities across the coun-try, ready to isolate those who cannot do so at home.We have procured and de-livered millions of items of personal protective equipment to hospitals, clinics and schools across the country to protect our frontline workers. We have re-cruited and continue to recruit additional nurses, doctors and emergency health personnel. We continue to make progress in our efforts to deal with COV-ID 19, but our greatest challenge still lies ahead. Across all prov-inces, we are working to further increase the number of general ward and critical beds available for COVID-19 patients. Ward capacity is being freed up in a number of hospitals by delaying non-urgent care, the conversion of some areas of hospitals into additional ward space and the erection or expansion of field hospitals. We are working to increase supplies of oxygen, ventilators and other equipment for those who will need critical care, in-cluding by diverting the supply of oxygen from other purpos-es. We are deploying digital technologies to strengthen the identification, tracing and isolation of contacts, and to provide support to those who test positive. As we now approach the peak of infections, we need to take extra precautions and tighten existing measures to slow down the rate of transmission. Regulations on the wearing of masks will be strengthened. Employers, shop owners and managers, public transport operators, and managers and owners of any other public building are now legally obliged to ensure that anyone entering their premises or ve-hicle must be wearing a mask. Taxis undertaking local trips will now be permitted to increase their capacity to 100 percent, while long distance taxis will not be allowed to exceed 70 percent occupancy, on condition that new risk mitigation protocols related to masks, vehicle sanitising and open windows are followed. There is now clear evidence that the resumption of alcohol sales has resulted in substantial pressure being put on hospitals, including trauma and ICU units, due to motor vehicle accidents, violence and related trauma. We have therefore de-cided that in order to conserve hospital capacity, the sale, dispensing and distribution of alcohol will be suspended with immediate effect. As an additional measure to reduce the pressure on hos-pitals, a curfew will be put in place between the hours of 9pm and 4am. We are taking these measures fully aware that they impose unwelcome restrictions on peo-ple\u2019s lives. They are, however, necessary to see us through the peak of the disease. There is no way that we can avoid the coronavirus storm. But we can limit the damage that it can cause to our lives. As a nation we have come together to support each other, to pro-vide comfort to those who are ill and to promote acceptance of people living with the virus. Now, more than ever, we are responsible for the lives of those around us. We will weather this storm. We will restore our country to health and to prosperity. We shall overcome.\n", "edition": "2020-08-ed1", "language_code": "eng"}
{"title": "Crew Juliet firefighter  shares her story\n", "author": "Dale Hes \n", "text": "Arendse grew up in the small Western Cape town of Beaufort West. After school, she tried studying at a college in Oudtshoorn, but decided to move back home to support her family. She worked at a supermarket for a while, but then firefighting caught her eye. \u201cI saw the firefighters in their uniforms and the big red trucks. I immediately became interested and wanted to find out more,\u201d says Arendse. Arendse was one of the graduates of the Western Cape government\u2019s Chrysalis Academy youth development programme in 2016. After the programme, she worked at the fire station in Beaufort West, earning only R1 900 per month. But then she came across an opportunity offered by NCC Environmental Ser-vices last year. \u201cI was at Chrysalis Acade-my as a facilitator when NCC came to talk to the students about the opportunity to ap-ply for training for the first all-female wildland firefight-ing team. Even though I was not one of the students, I was very interested and applied for the training, and I was accepted,\u201d Arendse says. Arendse went through the training, which combined theory and practical aspects of firefighting. \u201cI learnt so much. For one, I didn\u2019t know that there were firefighters tasked with putting out wildfires. I had previously thought they only worked in towns to put out fires in buildings,\u201d she says. Arendse adds that it was an amazing feeling to pass the training and become part of the first all-female firefight-ing team of its kind. \u201cI felt very excited, espe-cially because when I had told people I wanted to be a firefighter, many of them said I could not do it because I am a woman and would not cope with the job. This pushed me to show them that I can actu-ally do it, not only for myself but for the rest of the women in South Africa.\u201dArendse says that fighting her first major fire in Noor-dhoek was a challenging but highly rewarding experience. \u201cIt was my first full 24-hour shift and the first time we were working with all the other male firefighters. It was tiring and very hot in our protective gear but we finished the job and the feeling afterwards was very rewarding.\u201dArendse encourages the women of South Africa to never underestimate them-selves. \u201cDon\u2019t be defined by what people say you can and can\u2019t do.\u201d  \nWOMEN must blaze a trail, says firefighter.\nTo check for more opportunities offered by NCC Environmental Services, follow their Facebook page.

However, people who become very sick could be infectious and be able to transmit the virus to others for a longer period of time.Do I have to have anoth-er COVID-19 test, proving that I am negative, before I return to work?No. Re-testing people who have experienced mild illness and have recovered is not recommended. A person is considered safe to return to work and come out of isolation if they are no longer infectious. This means they developed their first symptoms more than 10 days ago and have not had any symptoms for at least three days.In most cases, employees can return to work without testing again if:\n\u2022 They have completed 10 days of mandatory quarantine or self-isolation.\u2022 Those who had moderate or severe symptoms undergo a medical evaluation.\u2022 They continue to practice personal hygiene and social distancing.\u2022 The employer monitors the worker to ensure they do not regress.\u2022 They wear a mask, from the date of diagnosis for at least 21 days.\nI have tested negative but I still have symptoms. What now?It is possible to get a false negative test result. This means that your first test could be negative, but you could test positive at a later stage. If you continue to have COVID-19 symptoms contact your healthcare professional.What if I am still show-ing symptoms after 10 days?It is common for patients to continue to have symptoms for longer than 10 days. Full recovery may take several weeks. If you still have symp-toms, seek advice from your healthcare professional.For more information about COVID-19, visit the National Institute for Communicable Diseases\u2019 website at www.nicd.ac.za, the COVID-19 free website at coronavirus.datafree.co, call the COVID-19 Hotline Number at 0800 029 999 or send a WhatsApp to  0600 12 3456.\n", "edition": "2020-08-ed2", "language_code": "eng"}
{"title": "Managing COVID-19: At home and at a dedicated facility\n", "author": "Allison Cooper\n", "text": "Many South Af ricans who test positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) cannot self-isolate because their home is too small for them to live and sleep in a room that\u2019s not shared by anyone else.Government has ensured that dedicated isolation facilities are available for people who have tested positive, and dedicated quarantine facilities are available for people who are still waiting for their test results. Both services are free.According to Dr Marlin McCay, a general practitioner based in Florida on the West Rand, the first thing you need to do when diagnosed with COVID-19 is to limit the spread of the infection. \u201cYou want to protect your family,\u201d he says. To do this, you need to go into isolation \u2013 either at home or at an isolation facility. \u201cIf you are self-isolating it means you have to find a part of the house where you are totally cut off from the rest of the family. No one should come within three metres of you. You must eat on your own; use your own cutlery and crockery; use your own bathroom, if possible; and make sure there\u2019s no contact with anyone else in the family.\u201cYour doctor or primary care giver should help you with certain basic medications to ease most of the symptoms, especially things like body aches and pains, headache and fever. There are also some good vitamins one can use to stay healthy,\u201d he says.It\u2019s also important to get enough rest and drink enough water or clear fluids to make sure that your urine stays a pale clear colour. Most people with mild illness will start feeling better within a week of the first symptoms, but it\u2019s important to monitor your symptoms carefully. If you develop any emergency warning signs, such as trouble breathing, chest pain or pressure in your chest that does not go away, coughing up blood, becoming confused, severe sleepi ness or blue lips or face you must call an ambulance or go to hospital immediately.For those who are not able to keep themselves away from others living in the home, government has setup free quarantine facilities around the country to keep you and your loved ones safe.The Western Cape Government recently published some comments from patients about its isolation facilities.Marie Jantjies from Witzenberg decided to follow healthcare workers\u2019 advice and go to the isolation facility because her 97-year-old mother lives with her and her children and she wanted to protect them. \u201cI was treated very well. The food was nice \u2013 even nicer than at home. I realised I just had to stay positive. I was anxious, but I prayed and tried to relax,\u201d she said.\u201cThat place can save lives! It really is the best,\u201d said John Arnoldus, who recovered from COVID-19 at an isolation facility in Drakenstein. \u201cOne of my friends was in quarantine at home and he struggled to recover on his own. I told him to contact the people who cared for me \u2013 that is the way to get better. The support of the medical staff and the manager there \u2013 that pulls you through,\u201d he said.Arnoldus was initially hesitant to go to the isolation facility because of the wrong perception that if you go to a facility like this you will get sicker and die. \u201cI expected the worst, but I was received so well. Hats off to the staff! They explained to me that as I already have COVID-19, no one at the facility could make me sick,\u201d he said.What can you expect from a quarantine facility?According to the Western Cape Government, all of your needs are taken of. You will receive regular meals, health monitoring by a healthcare worker, laundry services, comfort and quiet while you recover and free transport to and from the facility.\n\u201cIt\u2019s also important to get enough rest and drink enough water or clear fluids to make sure that your urine stays a pale clear colour.\u201d", "edition": "2020-08-ed2", "language_code": "eng"}
{"title": "Celebrating women through economic inclusion\n", "author": "vukuzenzele unnamed\n", "text": " The status and position of women in South Africa today is vastly different to that faced by our mothers and grandmothers in 1956. We have come a long way in realising a South Africa that is non-racial, non-sexist, dem-ocratic, prosperous and free. There has been real pro-gress in improving the lives of South African women in the economy, in the political sphere and in public life. At the same time, we know there is so much further we still have to go. Women still face discrimination, harass-ment and violence, and bear the greatest brunt of poverty. If we are to truly realise the promise of our Constitution we have to tackle the econom-ic and financial exclusion that makes women more vulnera-ble to abuse and violence. We have joined a ground-breaking campaign that links us to global efforts to achieve gender equality by 2030. Generation Equality is an ambitious and transform-ative agenda to end discrim-ination and violence against women and for their equal participation in political, social and economic life.As part of this campaign, we have joined two \u2018Action Coalitions\u2019, one for economic justice and rights and another against gender-based vio-lence. Both of these themes are critical to our own nation-al agenda. Eleven months since the Emergency Response Action Plan to combat gender-based violence and femicide was implemented we have made progress in expanding sup-port and care to survivors, and progress is being made in legal reforms to afford them greater protection.During the month of Au-gust, we begin the imple-mentation of the National Strategic Plan to combat gender-based violence and femicide. A key aspect of the plan is on ensuring greater women\u2019s financial inclusion. This is because economic inequality and social inequal-ity are interconnected. The economic status of women in South Africa makes them more vulnerable to abuse. We must therefore scale up support for women to enable them to become financially independent. We have made a number of commitments under Generation Equality that will be given effect to through the National Strate-gic Plan.Firstly, we are going to drive women\u2019s economic inclusion through public procurement. We have set the target of en-suring that at least 40 percent of goods and services pro-cured by public entities are sourced from women-owned businesses. Secondly, we are going to scale up support for wom-en-owned SMMEs and for women who work in the informal sector or are un-employed. This will include engagement with the finan-cial sector to make financial services accessible and af-fordable for women. Thirdly, we want to ensure more women have access to productive assets such as land. It is essential that women are beneficiaries of the accelerate land reform programme. It is significant that of the R75 million in COVID-19 relief earmarked for farming input vouchers 53 percent of the beneficiaries will be rural women. We must ensure that women subsist-ence and small-scale farmers continue to receive support beyond the pandemic.Fourthly, we want to ensure that women are protected from gender-based violence in the workplace. In this re-gard, we will be working at a national and regional level towards the ratification of the ILO Convention on Violence and Harassment in the Work-place. It is said that freedom is not given, but taken. The emancipation of wom-en is only words on paper unless it is matched by com-mitment from all sectors of society. As we prepare for the re-construction of our economy in the wake of the coronavi-rus pandemic, we have said that we cannot simply return to where we were before the outbreak of the virus. We must build a fundamentally different economy which, among other things, substan-tially improves the material position of women. This means that our invest-ment in infrastructure must support not only the devel-opment of local industry, but also women-owned business-es. It must deliberately create employment opportunities for women in all stages of planning, financing, building and maintaining infrastruc-ture. By the same measures, as we scale up our public employment programmes, we must ensure that young women in particular are identified as participants. In addition to an income, these programmes will provide them with an opportunity to acquire some of the skills and experience necessary to enter the mainstream economy.As much as it is govern-ment\u2019s responsibility to provide economic opportu-nities for women and create an enabling framework for advancing gender equality, everyone in society needs to play their part.Businesses must support women-owned enterprises in the procurement of goods and services. They should employ more women and appoint more women to management positions. This is all the more im-portant considering that the private sector\u2019s record on gender-representation at management level lags be-hind that of the public sector. This is an issue that is repeat-edly raised in engagements I have had with a number of women\u2019s business organ-isations. By equal measure, we must eliminate gender disparities in pay for men and women, and give effect to the principle of equal pay for equal work contained in the Employment Equity Act.Women must also be pro-tected from harassment and discrimination in the work-place. It is up to transport operators, university admin-istrators, school governing bodies and religious organ-isations to create conditions for women and girls to travel, study and worship in safety.We must forge ahead with our efforts to eradicate chauvinism, sexism and pa-triarchy. It is these attitudes that enable the oppression of women. It is up to us \u2013 both men and women \u2013 to affirm that a woman\u2019s value, position and opinions are no less than that of a man. It is up to us as parents and grandparents to treat and raise our sons and our daughters the same. It is up to us as men to reject and speak out against gender-based violence wher-ever we see it, even if it is against our friends, fathers or brothers. Let us be the generation that ends the oppression of women in all its forms, in our lifetime. The brave generation of 1956 marched for us all. We owe it to them, to ourselves and to future generations to not betray this noble legacy.", "edition": "2020-08-ed2", "language_code": "eng"}

Mashego is a third-year student studying towards a degree in civil engineering at the University of Pretoria.\u201cTuition fees are very expensive. For the course that I have chosen, I really could not afford to pay for a semester, never mind a single academic year,\u201d he explains.  Mashego matriculated in 2016 and was a top learner in his class, but had no means to pay for his studies. He successfully applied for funding from NSFAS for the 2018 academic year. \u201cThis gave me the opportunity to make my dream of studying engineering come true.

{"title": "Let\u2019s keep each other safe\n", "author": "vukuzenzele unnamed\n", "text": " It is a sign of the progress we are making in reducing new infections and demand on our health facilities. It is also a very important development as we strive to restart our economy. But it is too soon to celebrate. We are still very much in the middle of a deadly pandemic that has taken over 11,000 lives in South Africa alone. At more than half a million confirmed cases, we still have the fifth highest number of infections in the world. And there is always a chance of a resurgence of the disease. If we ever need a stark reminder of the need for vigilance, we should look to recent events thousands of kilometres away in New Zealand. Three months since the country was declared coronavirus-free, New Zealand is once again under lockdown. Although the latest outbreak was of relatively few cases, the government swiftly re-imposed lockdown restrictions. Similar restrictions have had to be reimposed in several parts of Europe as they experience a \u2018second wave\u2019 of infections. These experiences show just how swiftly things can change when it comes to COVID-19. It is a wake-up call to any among us who may harbour illusions that we are even close to seeing the end of this grave public health emergency. Certainly, there are signs of hope. The number of new confirmed cases in South Africa continues to decline. At the peak of the disease just one month ago, we were recording around 12,000 new cases a day. This has dropped to an average of around 5,000 a day over the past week. Our recovery rate stands at 80 percent. As the country moves to alert level 2, many restrictions on social and economic activity have been lifted. With this comes increased risk of transmission. We now need to manage this risk and ensure the gains we have made thus far in containing the pandemic\u2019s spread are not reversed. The greatest threat to the health of nation right now is complacency. It may be that we are now permitted to meet friends and family, to visit entertainment venues, to travel for leisure and to consume alcohol in restaurants, bars and taverns. But as the old adage goes, just because you can, doesn\u2019t mean you should. Many people who have the coronavirus do not have symptoms and may not even know they are infected. This is a sobering reality because it means that any of us could be infected right now and could unwittingly infect others. This is particular the case when visiting relatives, especially the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions that render them vulnerable to infection. It is also true for attending religious services or cultural activities. The \u2018second wave\u2019 of infections that several other countries have experienced is an ever-present possibility for us too. Although many restrictions have been lifted, it does not mean they will not return should we experience a significant rise in infections. This pandemic is a matter of life and death. We need to adapt and we need to be vigilant. In the days, weeks and months that lie ahead, we must urgently focus our efforts on recovery. Our economy and our society has suffered a great deal. As we return to economic activity across almost all industries \u2013 and work to repair the damage done \u2013 we have a responsibility to not let our guard down as individuals, employers, communities, families, professionals, workers and citizens. None of us wants a return to the early days of extreme lockdown restrictions. We want to move on with our lives. We want our friends and loved ones to remain healthy and safe. As a nation, let us continue to work together to ensure that we progress. The move to alert level 2 of the lockdown is not a \u2018free for all.\u2019 The rules on social distancing, mask wearing, social gatherings and international travel remain. Our success rests on our ability to abide by these regulations and to ensure that we each behave carefully and responsibly.Every time we are considering any form of non-essen tial activity, we should ask: what is the risk of infection to ourselves and to others? Where there is a risk, even a slight one, it is better not to do it. Let us proceed, as ever, with caution. Let us keep each other safe.\n", "edition": "2020-09-ed1", "language_code": "eng"}
{"title": "Protect our women and children \n", "author": "vukuzenzele unnamed\n", "text": "At the time, the nation was reeling from the murders of Uyinene Mrwetyana, Leighandre Jegels, Jesse Hess and a number of other wom-en who had lost their lives at the hands of brutal men.From all social backgrounds, young and old, students and working women, the peaceful protesters held aloft placards that read \u2018Enough is Enough\u2019 and \u2018Am I next?\u2019. The anguish and the anger was palpable that day. As I received their clearly articulated demands, it was clear to me that we needed to act urgently and with determination. It was important to me that I did not respond with hollow words and empty promises.A few days later, I called a joint sitting of Parliament, where we announced a R1.6 billion Emergency Response Action Plan to combat gender-based violence and femicide (GBVF).Over the six months of its implementation, public spending in various gov-ernment departments was reprioritised to support interventions for care and support for survivors, for awareness and prevention campaigns, to improve laws and policies, to promote the economic empowerment of women, and to strengthen the criminal justice system.And now we are on the cusp of the most far-reaching leg-islative overhaul in the fight against GBVF.Three key Bills relating to GBVF have been introduced in Parliament recently. Through the introduction of these Bills, we are honouring the promise we made to the protestors last year and to all the women of this country.The three amendment Bills are designed to fill the gaps that allow some perpetrators of these crimes to evade justice and to give full effect to the rights of our country\u2019s women and children.These Bills, once finalised, will help to restore the confi-dence of our country\u2019s wom-en that the law is indeed there to protect them. The first is the Bill to amend the Criminal Law (Sexual Of-fences and Related Matters) Amendment Act. This creates a new offence of sexual intim-idation, extends the ambit of the offence of incest, and extends the reporting duty of persons who suspect a sexual offence has been committed against a child.It expands the scope of the National Register for Sex Offenders (NRSO) to include the particulars of all sex offenders. Until now, it has only applied to sex offend-ers convicted of sex crimes perpetrated against children or persons with mental disa-bilities. The time an offend-er\u2019s particulars must remain on the register has been increased, and those listed on the register will have to disclose this when they sub-mit applications to work with vulnerable persons. The Bill also provides for the names of persons on the NRSO to be publicly available.The Criminal and Related Matters Amendment Bill tightens, among others, the granting of bail to perpetra-tors of GBVF, and expands the offences for which minimum sentences must be imposed.The amendments impose new obligations on law-en-forcement officials and on our courts.When a prosecutor does not oppose bail in cases of GBV, they have to place their reasons on record. Unless a person accused of GBV can provide exceptional circum-stances why they should be released on bail, the court must order their detention until the criminal proceed-ings are concluded.In reaching a decision on a bail application, the courts are compelled to take a num-ber of considerations into ac-count. They include pre-trial reports on the desirability of releasing an accused on bail, threats of violence made against a survivor, and the view of the survivor regard-ing his or her safety.When it comes to parole, a complainant or a relative of a deceased victim must be able to make representation to the parole board. Given the unacceptably high levels of intimate partner violence in our country, we have tightened the provisions of the Domestic Violence Act. Domestic violence is now defined to cover those in engagements, dating, in cus-tomary relationships, and actual or perceived romantic, intimate or sexual relation-ships of any duration.The Bill also extends the definition of \u2018domestic vio-lence\u2019 to include the protec-tion of older persons against abuse by family members.Complainants will be able to apply for a protection order online. To prevent a scenario where perpetrators can hide past histories of domestic violence, an integrated repos-itory of protection orders will be established.The proposed amendments also oblige the departments of Social Development, Basic Education, Higher Education and Health to provide certain services to survivors where needed and to refer them for sheltering and medical care.The circumstances under which a prosecutor can refuse to institute a prose-cution when offences have been committed under the amended Act or to withdraw charges when it involves the infliction of bodily harm or where a weapon was used to threaten a complainant have been limited. In perhaps the most ground-breaking proposed amend-ment to the Act, if someone has knowledge, reasonable belief or suspicion that an act of domestic violence has been committed against a child, a person with disability or an older person and fails to report it to a social worker or police officer they can be fined and even imprisoned. Similarly, failure by a mem-ber of the SAPS to comply with their obligations under the Act will be regarded as misconduct and must be reported to the Civilian Sec-retariat for Police Service.The law is the one sure protector of all of society, but especially its most vulner-able. When diligently and fairly applied, it is the most powerful guarantor of justice.The women of South Af-rica have had enough of lukewarm actions that do not address one of the most fundamental rights of all \u2013 to live in freedom from fear.This government and its partners will make good by the women of South Africa. We will not let them down.", "edition": "2020-09-ed2", "language_code": "eng"}
{"title": "Woza Matrics launched\n", "author": "Dale Hes  \n", "text": "The Department of Basic Education (DBE) has en-sured that the safe re-open-ing of schools is one of its top priorities, along with supporting learners with various programmes to help them successfully complete the academic year. One of these is the Woza Matrics programme, which was launched on 1 Septem-ber in collaboration with a number of broadcasting partners and educational experts. As part of the programme, catch-up lessons on six key matric subjects are being aired on SABC, DStv and Openview (Channel 122) every day for 12 weeks, from 8am to 10am and 1pm to 3pm. The goal is to help learners to prepare for their final exams. The platform also provides live lessons, during which learners can ask teachers questions. Exam tips are also provided. Woza Matrics recognises that while all learners have lost school time, Grade 12s have been the most severely affected, as their marks are extremely important for their career and university acceptance.  Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga says the programme is vital, considering the disruption to learn ing caused by COVID-19. \u201cMatric is always stressful, but 2020 has been filled with unusual stresses. I want to congratulate all our Grade 12 learners and their families for their perseverance and determination. It is abundantly clear that additional support is required for learners and we will continue to provide this. There are a few months left before the end of the year and Woza Matrics will give learners the support they need to prepare for the final exams,\u201d she says.The programme is unique in that it targets the majority of Grade 12s in the country who do not have regular access to the Internet and connected digital devices. Broadcasts will be available to view by most of the 1.2 million learners who are writing Matric exams in November. The Council of Education Ministers has urged all learners and parents to make use of the platform. SABC CEO Madoda Mxakwe says the broadcaster is proud to be part of the initiative. \u201cWe are pleased to be one of the key role-players in saving the 2020 Matric year. As a public service broadcaster, we are duty-b ound to ensure that our content in-cludes a significant number of educational programmes, particularly during a period when it is most needed.\u201dYour questions answeredWhat subjects will be covered?\u2022 Maths\u2022 Geography\u2022 Life sciences \u2022 Physical sciences \u2022 Accounting \u2022 Maths literacy. Why were these time slots chosen, because learners could be at school?\u2022 School attendance times vary across districts and provinces, due to social distancing measures. Many Matrics will be at home at the time of broadcasting. \u2022 A small percentage of learners are also being home-schooled. \u2022 The main broadcasts will be repeated after 4pm on Openview and are available on DStv Catch-Up. Why only Matrics?\u2022 Matrics are under the most pressure to plan their post-school lives.\u2022 Matrics have faced more significant disruption to their schooling since March 2020 because their curriculum was not shortened.\u2022 Matrics have fallen the furthest behind on curricu lum learning.Where can I find the viewing schedule?The viewing schedule is available in TV guides and on the Woza Matrics website at wozamatrics.co.za.\nRepeat broadcasts will be available. Is support being provided to parents and teach ers?Yes. The broadcast schedule will have some sessions on tips for parents on ways to support their Matric children. Some sessions will focus on teachers and the DBE's Teacher Connect WhatsApp platform will communicate key messages to teachers. Will there be a focus on dealing with the stresses faced by Matrics?Yes. There will be several sessions focused on providing tips for student well-being, coping with stress and managing anxiety.\nFor more information, visit the Woza Matrics website at wozamatrics.co.za or email info@wozamatrics.co.zaTHE WOZA MATRICS  programme aims to help all Grade 12 learners pass their final examinations.", "edition": "2020-09-ed2", "language_code": "eng"}
{"title": "Court support  for GBV victims\n", "author": "More Matshediso \n", "text": "The Ke Bona Lesedi Court Preparation Programme is available at most Sexual Offences Courts and other courts that deal with GBV. Ke Bona Lesedi means \u2018I see the light\u2019 when translated from Setswana. A GBV victim can submit a request to the NPA for assis-tance. The senior public pros-ecutor or court preparation manager will then identify an appropriate court preparation officer to assist. \u201cThe service does not prom-ise a particular outcome in the case and each individ-ual\u2019s experience is unique. Nonetheless, it assists with empowerment and restoring the victim\u2019s dignity,\u201d says a statement from the NPA. There are 161 court prepara-tion officers at various courts across the country. The service is one of vari-ous initiatives introduced by government to deal with the scourge of GBV. According to the NPA, the complainant, victim, survivor or witness will be contacted by a court preparation officer from the court where she or he will testify. The court preparation officer will be available to support the complainant at court and throughout the trial. Special-ised tools and techniques are used to visually show the victim that she or he is heard, protected and respected. Complainants can speak in their own language and the court preparation officer will ensure that the victim is referred for counselling or therapy, to complete their healing journey. Many women and children who have suffered GBV, for example, rape, are anxious about going to court to testify and relate intimate details of events in front of strangers.

{"title": "SA media is a key pillar of our democracy \n", "author": "vukuzenzele unnamed\n", "text": "But countries with strong institutions, vigilant judicial systems and a robust media have been able to prevent human rights from being undermined and the authority of the state being abused. It has been six months since the national state of disaster was proclaimed. Despite the unprecedented nature of the disease and the immense challenge of placing a country of 58 million people under lockdown, we have fared well. We have managed to contain the spread of the disease primarily because of the cooperation and vigilance of all citizens.This is in no small part due to the sterling work of our media.We owe a debt of gratitude to South Africa\u2019s hardworking and tenacious journalists. They have kept our people informed by disseminating key health messages about social distancing and hygiene. They have done so under extremely trying conditions, often with limited resources.They have told the stories of the effects of lockdown on the lives of people and their businesses. They have been out in the villages, towns and cities, bringing stories of ordinary people and drawing national attention to problems being experienced in hospitals and clinics, prompting government action.Our media have also shone a light on excesses that perhaps would not have ordinarily come to light. They have fulfilled their watchdog role by unearthing acts of corruption and maladministration, sparking a massive national debate and leading to a number of high-profile investigations. Through this reporting they have earned people\u2019s trust.A free press is not an end in itself. It is a means by which democracy is secured and upheld. During this pandemic, our media has played not just its traditional watchdog role, but exercised its civic duty in supporting the national effort to contain the coronavirus.Given the importance of the media to the health of our de-mocracy, it is a great concern that like all other sectors of the economy, the coronavirus crisis has hit our media houses hard. Some publications lost as much as 60 percent of their income in the early days of the lockdown. A number of companies have had to implement salary cuts, reduce staff numbers or reduce hours worked. Regrettably, some publications have even been forced to close, among them some of South Africa\u2019s most established and well-known magazine titles.The job losses that have resulted from the lockdowns have exacerbated a crisis for media companies already facing challenges like loss of advertising revenues, falling circulation and market share being taken by mobile-first news and other technologies. These financial difficulties are being faced across the board, from online titles to traditional broadsheets to the public broadcaster.This was one of the issues that was raised sharply during my engagement with the South African National Editors\u2019 Forum recently. Instead of lamenting their fate, however, the media industry is working hard to refine business models, to drive innovation and to retain staff as much as possible. At the same time, the media is a unique entity in any society because its practitioners fulfil a role that is so essential to our democratic order. They work to keep the public informed and to keep power in check. We need more journalists, not less. That is why the loss of even a single journalist is not just a loss to the industry but to the country.We need our media veterans, who bring with them vast experience and institutional memory, and are able to offer critical reportage and informed analysis. At the same time we need more young journalists in the profession who are tech-savvy, abreast with new trends in storytelling and in touch with the concerns of a youthful population.As a society we owe the media our full support. Whether it is electing to pay for content, supporting crowdfunded journalism, paying our SABC license fees or simply buying a newspaper, we can all play our part to support this industry in crisis. As government, despite the gloomy economic climate we will continue to extend advertising spend to publications and broadcasters, especially community media.The private sector must also continue to support the industry through advertising and working with media houses in the production of innovative content in line with global media trends. Local philanthropic and donor organisations should also come on board and support public interest journalism ventures, as is the case in many democracies.The proliferation of fake news during the pandemic, primarily on social media platforms, has added to the urgency for more news that is accurate, fair and impartial. During this time our people have relied on our established media houses for information, once again underscoring their importance as pillars of our democracy.As we begin the great task of rebuilding our economy in the aftermath of the pandemic, the media industry will need our support more than ever. The free press was once described as \u2018the unsleeping guardian of every other right that free men and women prize\u2019. As we salute their role in this pandemic, let us do what we can to ensure that the free and diverse media in our country is able to survive and thrive.", "edition": "2020-10-ed1", "language_code": "eng"}

Teenagers, however, need to decide for themselves.Many people do not want to wait until they are mar-ried before having sex. They also do not want to rush into anything and make costly mistakes. They often decide that delaying having sex until they are older, more responsible, in a stable re-lationship with one partner and have a job, is the best thing to do.If you choose abstinence or delaying sex, there are other things you can do to protect yourself:\n\u2022 Choose your friends care fully. Friends should want what is best for you and should respect your decision not to have sex.\u2022 Beware of situations that could be unsafe, like friends drinking or taking drugs, that could lead to unsafe sex.\u2022 Beware of partners who claim that you will sleep with them if you love them.\u2022 Listen to and learn from those who have gone through teenage pregnancy. They know the mistakes and disadvantages.\u2022 Listen to and learn from your parents about their life experiences. If you decide that absti-nence and delaying sex are not the best decisions for you and you would rather not wait, take the time to learn about protection, including contraception, which is using a method (mechanical or chemical) to prevent pregnancy.

{"title": "Transforming the agricultural sector\n", "author": "vukuzenzele unnamed\n", "text": "Agricultural land is the mainstay of our natural resource base. The availability and sustainable use of farmland to grow crops and for animal husbandry is key to our very survival.South Africa has vast tracts of land suitable for agricultural production, with 37,9% of our total land area currently being used for commercial agriculture.Like many other countries, our arable land is under threat from land degradation, water scarcity and urban encroachment. We are also losing prime agricultural land through land-use changes.Given our history, broadening access to agricultural land for commercial production and subsistence farming is a national priority.Although the post-1994 land reform process has resulted in more land being restored and restituted to black South Africans, the pernicious effects of the 1913 Natives Land Act continue to be in patterns of farmland ownership.The Act went far beyond dispossessing millions of people of their ancestral land.With land ownership still concentrated in the hands of the few, and agriculture primary production and value chains mainly owned by white commercial farmers, the effects of our past remain with us today. The continued monopolization of a key means of production like land is not just an obstacle to advancing a more egalitarian society; it is also a recipe for social unrest. The hunger for land to farm is growing, especially amongst the rural poor. And for a number of reasons, the pace of land reform in this particular sector has been slow and unsatisfactory. Transforming patterns of agricultural land ownership is vital not just to address the historical injustices of the past, but to safeguard our nation\u2019s food security. As noted in the 2019 report of the Presidential Advisory Panel on Land Reform and Agriculture, \u201cwhilst we export food, back home 41% of people in rural areas and 59,4% in urban areas have severely inadequate access to food.\u201d Agrarian reform has been a priority of successive administrations since democracy. Between 1994 and March 2018 the State has delivered 8,4 million hectares of land to previously disadvantaged individuals under the land reform programme. But this progress amounts to less than 10% of all commercial farmland. In my State of the Nation Address earlier this year I committed that state-owned agricultural land would soon be released for farming. This is a major milestone in the agrarian reform process, and gives effect to the promise of the Freedom Charter that the land shall be shared among those who work it.Our redistributive vision aims to strike a balance between social justice and redress, and enhancing agricultural output by bringing more black farmers into the mainstream of the economy.Land is a productive asset that generates profit and can be used for collateral to secure other assets.We have to ensure that land acquired for farming purposes is productively used. To safeguard the allocated state land for farming purposes, the lease is not transferrable. Beneficiaries will sign a lease agreement with the State and pay a rental fee consistent with the land value.We must also ensure that farmers are supported along the road to sustainability and profitability.As part of this programme, beneficiaries will be trained in financial management and enterprise development. Experience has shown that emerging and small-scale farmers often lack the financial skills to exploit market opportunities and integrate with value chains.We are prioritizing women, youth and persons with disabilities as beneficiaries.There has been demonstrable success with empowering women farmers under the existing Proactive Land Acquisition Strategy. In a number of provinces, women who have been allocated farms by the DALRRD have been able to run them successfully and even move into commercial production.In addition to the land acquisition itself, the department continues to invest in infrastructure, equipment and machinery to enable these entrepreneurs to run successful businesses.Broadening access to land and opportunities for farming will support job creation and enterprise development, and improve the market for food, agricultural goods and services.The ultimate goal of releasing these land parcels is to transform the agricultural landscape by growing a new generation of farmers. Leasing land under such favourable conditions must spur them to think big; to not just grow their own businesses but to advance shared wealth and prosperity in the communities in which they farm.They must heal the deep divisions of our past. They must dispel the stereotype that only white farmers are commercially successful in South Africa, and that black farmers are perpetually \u2018emerging.\u2019In working this land; in turning it to productive use, they will indeed turn swords into ploughshares. They will become the faces of national reconciliation.", "edition": "2020-10-ed2", "language_code": "eng"}

{"title": "Building a society that works\n", "author": "vukuzenzele unnamed\n", "text": " We are undertaking a far-reaching and ambitious public investment in human capital, with the state as both a creator and an enabler of jobs. The Presidential Employment Stimulus is unprecedented in its scale and breadth, involving a public investment of R100 billion over the next three years.We will protect and create directly-funded jobs and livelihood support interventions while the labour market recovers from the coronavirus pandemic. Each of these is ready for implementation, and is additional to existing commitments.While some of the interventions build on the strengths of existing programmes, the stimulus also includes new and innovative approaches. This includes a focus on what we have termed \u2018social employment\u2019. We are working from the premise that there is no shortage of work to be done to address the many social problems in our society. The aim is to support the considerable creativity, initiative and institutional capabilities that exist in the wider society to engage people in work that serves the common good. This work cuts across a range of themes, including food security, ending gender-based violence, informal settlement upgrading and much more.This will supplement the efforts of the public sector, allowing for greater scale and social impact as well as new forms of partnership with diverse social actors.The stimulus includes a new national programme to employ teaching and school assistants in schools. Schools are making these appointments right now, delivering new opportunities in every community across the length and breadth of the country.Public employment is not just for unskilled work. There is a cross-cutting focus on graduates, with opportunities for nurses, science graduates, artisans and others.The stimulus will also protect jobs in vulnerable sectors that have been hit hard by the pandemic. Support will be provided to Early Childhood Development practitioners, mainly self-employed women. Over 74,000 small farmers will also receive production input grants.As a nation, we need arts and culture to lift our spirits once more \u2013 the stimulus provides new funding to help the sector back onto its feet, including support to digital content-creation and expansion of e-commerce platforms.This will enable artists to adapt to the new market conditions that the pandemic has imposed on us all and to seize new opportunities for growth.A critical enabler for wider job creation, made more important by the pandemic, is connectivity. To overcome the digital divide, the stimulus will provide affordable, high-speed broadband to low-income households through innovative connection subsidies and the expansion of free public WiFi.As our country recovers from the devastation of the Coronavirus pandemic, we are in no doubt as to the size of the task before us. We have to achieve an economic recovery that is swift and inclusive. We have to get as many of our people as pos-sible working again. We also have to regain lost ground in the provision of basic services and critical infrastructure, addressing social challenges and transforming townships and rural communities too. Public employment is an instrument that can do all of the above: creating jobs at scale in the short term while markets recover, and creating social value in the process. The example is often cited of the massive public works programme undertaken by the United States after the Great Depression in the 1930s. This was not just a stimulus, but also promoted social participation and inclusion.There are several examples of innovative public employment programmes in the developing world, including in India, Ethiopia and here in South Africa. These programmes make a direct investment in local economies, reaching poorer areas first, supporting local small enterprises and trickling up into the wider economy from there.They also promote social participation and inclusion, providing communities with the means to change their lives as they undertake new forms of work. In doing so, they contribute to transformation both at a local level and within broader society.Direct public investment to support employment and create economic opportunities that generate social value does more than just tackle the unemployment crisis.It is responsive, because it uses the state\u2019s resources to respond to local community needs, be it for greener spaces, food security, more early childhood development centres, or for better and more accessible roads.It is progressive, because it offers social protection and income security to those who face destitution because they are unable to find work.It is an investment in the future, in that it supports the broader economic recovery agenda by urgently getting our people to work on improving our national and municipal infrastructure.Through the interventions in the stimulus, we are creating work for those who need it, while leaving a lasting impact on entire communities.Like public employment programmes across the world, this employment stimulus supports and complements the critical role of the private sector in creating jobs. It is counter-cyclical, in that as the recovery advances, the scale of public employment will decline. The work experience and skills acquired by beneficiaries of the Presidential Employment Stimulus will improve their prospects of securing formal employment. The experience gained is also a pathway to entrepreneurial activity. Participants will improve their skills and capabilities to start their own businesses, and can use the steady income provided by public employment to branch out into other income-generating activities. I have consistently affirmed that the COVID-19 crisis is also a window of opportunity to build back better.At this time of great upheaval, we would be doing ourselves no favours by making unrealistic promises that raise expectations, only to come short when they are not met. This is why each of the jobs and livelihood support interventions is fully funded, with a clear implementation plan. The employment stimulus is not about vague commitments for some time in the future, but about jobs being created right here and now.The stimulus is the result of extensive consultation with national departments, provinces and metros to rapidly design employment pro grammes that can be rolled out or expanded within six months.The implementing departments and other stakeholders were rigorously assessed on their capacity to implement.In every one of the programmes that fall under the stimulus, opportunities will be widely advertised and recruitment will be fair, open and transparent.The goals we have set ourselves are realistic, measura ble and achievable, and draw lessons from past experience and international best prac tice.\nOur people are ready and willing to work. This vast potential must be harnessed, and our collective skills and capabilities brought to bear in rebuilding our country in the wake of the coronavirus.The Presidential Employment Stimulus provides a respite for families who have endured a long hard winter with greatly reduced income, and for individuals who have spent many years without work.Real, decent work is the right of every human being. It is a precondition for economic growth and social stability.By giving effect to this fundamental right, the Presidential Employment Stimulus is making a decisive contribution to building a society that works.", "edition": "2020-11-ed1", "language_code": "eng"}
{"title": "Recovery on the  horizon for SA\n", "author": "vukuzenzele unnamed\n", "text": "When the National State of Disaster was declared in March, our immediate prior-ity was to contain the spread of the virus and provide emergency relief to citizens, communities, workers and businesses.Over the course of eight months and with the support of our social partners, we rolled out a comprehensive set of measures to limit the social and economic impact of the pandemic.We massively expanded social protection on a scale that has never been attempt-ed before in this country. We are one of the few countries in the world where the right of access to social security is enshrined in the Constitu-tion, and we can be proud that during this grave crisis we gave practical expression to this right in many ways. In addition to our existing social grants, which reach more than 17 million people every month, we topped-up the Old Age, Disability and Child Support grants. We rolled out a Special Corona-virus Disease (COVID-19) So-cial Relief of Distress Grant, which has reached some six million people to date. This was done within weeks of the National State of Disaster being declared.The scale of such an un-dertaking cannot be under-stated. To bring this system online there was extensive collaboration between the South African Social Security Agency, South African Rev-enue Service, Home Affairs and many others.We set up a fully automated application and disbursement process, and integrated mul-tiple databases, including the National Population Register and the Unemployment In-surance Fund (UIF) database. We set up new application channels like WhatsApp and USSD, and created systems with the commercial banks to enable banking detail ver-ification. This is a remarkable achievement in a very short space of time.Alongside the measures we took to protect and sus-tain livelihoods, we also supported ailing businesses. We provided relief to small businesses in the form of debt relief, finance, tax payment deferrals and other instru-ments.We implemented a COV-ID-19 Loan Guarantee Scheme to enable businesses to meet their operational ex-penses during the lockdown, and are currently looking at how this scheme can reach more companies in need.We provided income protec-tion to workers and relief to business owners through the Temporary Employer Relief Scheme administered by the UIF.These were all in direct re-sponse to an emergency and were by nature temporary. Some are now coming to an end, while others have been extended as the labour mar-ket recovers.The measures we imple-mented went a long way towards protecting our soci-ety from the harsh winds of COVID-19. The additional grants helped to prevent mil-lions of people from falling below the food poverty line.Had we not intervened to secure livelihoods and save businesses, the living condi-tions of our people and the circumstances of thousands of businesses would have been considerably worse.Now we are in a transition from relief to recovery.The emergency measures we put in place have laid a firm foundation on which to rebuild our economy. As our focus now shifts to the imple-mentation of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan, our priority will be to stimulate growth and create jobs.There has already been progress in a number of areas.We are seeing new funding commitments for infrastruc-ture development following an infrastructure project roundtable last week. A number of employment programmes under the Presidential Employment Stimulus have started. We are pushing ahead with economic reforms in areas such as energy and telecommunications.Plans are being converted to action and commitments are being reflected in jobs and opportunities.It is all the more critical at this time, more so with the festive season approaching, that we do not become the architects of our own undoing.The greatest vigilance is required from us all to keep the virus at bay.A resurgence at any scale will not just dramatically reverse our health gains. It will choke the green shoots of economic recovery that have emerged, and take us back from spring to winter.To prevent a second wave of COVID-19 infections, we must observe the public health guidelines that remain in place.When we fail to wear a mask at a social gathering, when we attend crowded events, we are not only putting ourselves and others at risk. We are also putting our economic recovery in jeopardy.Let us all continue to play our part.The positive actions of wearing a mask, of maintaining social distancing and of regular hand washing helped us overcome the worst effects of the pandemic. They are still our best defence.Let us remember the sacrifices we all had to make to contain the spread of the virus in the early days.Even as most social and eco-nomic activity has resumed, we must still observe all the health measures. This is abso-lutely necessary if we are to rebuild our economy and put this crisis behind us.\n", "edition": "2020-12-ed1", "language_code": "eng"}

There are no costs involved.\nWho qualifies? \n\u2022 People who want to im prove their matric results, whether they wrote matric recently or even decades ago. Dr Malapile explains that a person wanting to obtain an engineering qualification, for in stance, might need to im prove their mathematics mark to qualify for the course.\n\u2022 People who failed matric and want a second chance at passing.\u2022 People who left school after passing Grade 9 (then Standard 7), are 21 or older, and wish to obtain their matric.\nHow to get startedRegister at one of the 75 dis trict education offices across the country or online at this website: www.eservices.gov.za.Registration opened on 1 October and will close in February 2021. Learners either study on their own or at one of the 133 Second Chance centres where face-to-face learning takes place after-hours and on weekends. Dr Malapile says only the top performing teachers in each district are employed at these centres. The centres are not available in every town and village, but are located in areas where the greatest number of people have registered, which means their location could change each year.Both face-to-face learners and learners who study at home have access to a full range of study support services, from lessons broadcast on radio and television at specific times; to downloadable online material; and, for those without access to computers, printers and the inter net\u2212printed study material is sent to them by the DBE. People with a computer but no internet or data, may request a CD with all the study material, which will be mailed to them.\u201cMany adult learners may not have lots of time to devote to their studies. Luck ily, they may decide how many subjects they want to do a year because they do not have to complete their matric within a set time.\u201dOnce registered, the DBE will help each older learner choose the subjects they want to do and explain which ones are compulsory. On qualifying, people who left school after 2008 receive a National Senior Certificate and those who left school earlier, receive an Amended Senior Certificate. However, Dr Malapile says both qualifications carry the same weight and, depending on the subjects taken and marks achieved, can be used to apply to universities and colleges.\nGiving second chancesThe DBE holds community roadshows to encourage people to enrol for the Second Chance programme. Tertiary education institutions and SETAs are invited to provide as much information as possible to interested people.At many of these roadshows, Minister Angie Mot shekga was asked by youth to introduce programmes that could assist young people to be more employable, says Dr Malapile. In response, the DBE is launching a skills development programme this year that will target about 3.4 million young people who are not in employment, education or training. Courses will range from life skills \u2013 covering topics such as how to write a CV and what to do at a job interview; to basic skills courses, such as shoe repair, basic ITC and literacy.Did you know?\n\u2022 Regardless of whether you left school in the 60s or recently, you have to study the current curriculum.\n\u2022 The South African education system also caters for people who dropped out before Grade Nine, through the Department of Higher Education and Training\u2019s adult basic education and training programme.\n", "edition": "2021-01-ed1", "language_code": "eng"}
{"title": "SA overcoming HIV and Aids \n", "author": "Vukuzenzele Unnamed\n", "text": "For more than three dec ades, our country has been engaged in an ongoing struggle against HIV and AIDS, which has cost many lives and caused great hardship and suffering.\nSince the outbreak of COV ID-19 in the country, with the nation-wide lockdown and the pressure on our health facilities, many HIV , AIDS and tuberculosis services have suffered. This has posed a challenge for people testing and starting antiretroviral treatment. Many people found it difficult to collect their medicines and fewer people accessed other services, such as voluntary male medical circumcision.\nAt the same time, there are many lessons that have been learnt from our public health response to the coronavirus pandemic that can strengthen our fight against HIV and TB.\nSouth Africa continues to have the largest number of people living with HIV in the world. It is encouraging, however, that over the last decade we made progress in reducing the number of new HIV infections in the population by nearly 60%.It is also encouraging that HIV infections in adolescent girls and young women have significantly declined in the last decade. This is a crucial group because they are much more likely to be at risk of getting HIV .Our treatment programme has contributed to a reduction in the number of deaths due to AIDS by 60%. There has been a greater reduction in HIV-related deaths among young people.\nIt was possible to reduce the number of deaths because we, together with our partners, have rolled out an extensive antiretroviral programme reaching millions of people living with the disease. At the beginning of the decade, our programme to prevent mother to child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV had very low coverage. Now we have one of the highest rates of coverage of PMTCT in Southern Africa, which has substantially reduced rates of infection among children.While we have reduced deaths and new infections, we still are far from reaching the goal we committed ourselves in 2016 of achieving a 75% reduction in HIV infections by 2020. If we succeed in doing so, we are likely to end AIDS as a public health threat by 2030.Unfortunately, we are not there yet. We have to do far more to ensure that young people are empowered to prevent infections, including through changing behaviour, accessing condoms and testing regularly. We need to make sure that everyone who is infected has access to treatment and care.We need to work harder on HIV prevention among key populations, including sex workers, men who have sex with men, and people who inject drugs. We must end the stigma and discrimination towards these populations. We cannot hope to end HIV if we ignore the needs, concerns and rights of any part of our population.South Africa needs to increase efforts to medically circumcise young men to reduce their risk of acquiring HIV . Unsafe circumcision should not leave young men with lifelong health problems, and no one should die from circumcision. We must make sure that young men have safe circumcision.We are encouraged by findings of a recent study on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Unlike antiretroviral treatment that is given to people who are HIV positive, PrEP involves the regular use of antiretroviral drugs by HIV negative people to prevention infection. The study, conducted by scientists from the HIV Prevention Trials Network, found that long-acting injections once every eight weeks was better than the daily tablet used for HIV prevention. These findings have the potential to significantly strengthen our response to the epidemic.If we are to succeed in ending AIDS as a public health threat within the next decade, we need to combine these medical breakthroughs with fundamental changes in behaviour. We also need to tackle the economic and social conditions that contrib ute to high rates of infection.\nOne of our central tasks is to empower adolescent girls and young women, educationally, economically and socially. They need to be able to make their own decisions about every aspect of their lives, including their sexuality and sexual behaviour.Ultimately, we will achieve the end of AIDS through the empowerment of young people, women and other people at risk. This includes empowerment through access to information, advice and support. It includes access to education and economic opportunities, especially for young women. Empowerment also means that every person must have access to testing, treatment and other health services.\nThe people of South Africa have come so far, endured so much and made such great progress in the fight against HIV , AIDS and Tuberculosis. Let us intensify both our resolve and our actions to confront and overcome AIDS once and for all.  ", "edition": "2021-01-ed1", "language_code": "eng"}
{"title": "A better 2021 for all South Africans The first weeks of the year have been difficult for all South Africans.\n", "author": "Vukuzenzele Unnamed\n", "text": " While most economic sec-tors have been able to operate again for several months, it will take some time for the economy to recover and for lost jobs to be restored. As the new year starts, many fami-lies are still feeling the effects of the pandemic on their lives and livelihoods. The world is now entering the second year of the coro-navirus pandemic. For South Africa, as for most countries around the world, the year 2021 will be extremely chal-lenging. The second wave of COVID-19 infections may well be followed by further waves, which will threaten both the health of our peo-ple and the recovery of our economy.Difficult as this year will be, I am certain that we will overcome the pandemic and set our country firmly on the path to recovery. My confidence comes from the South African people. If I look at how South Africans responded to this crisis from the moment the virus arrived on our shores, I have no doubt that we have the resil-ience, discipline and ability to defeat this disease. Certainly there were excep-tions, but the vast majority of South Africans understood the need for restrictions on their movement and activ-ities, and complied with the regulations that we had to put in place. Even more important than compliance, most South Africans took responsibility for themselves and for others, following advice on issues like social distancing, wearing a mask and hand washing.And where we fell short, we have, sadly, seen the conse-quences. We now know about the risks of closed spaces and crowded gatherings, of not wearing masks and not keeping our distance from others. This bodes well for the year ahead. We now know much more about the disease and how to prevent its spread. And despite what one could call \u2018pandemic fatigue\u2019, we are no less determined as South Africans to do what needs to be done. As we adhere even more rigorously to the basic pre-vention measures, we will also be rolling out a mass vaccination campaign. As more and more people are vaccinated, we will both save lives and progressively reduce the risk of infection across the population. Getting enough vaccines as quickly as possible \u2013 and making sure that they reach the people who need them \u2013 will be one of the biggest tasks of the year. This will be particularly challenging as every country in the world is clamouring to secure a limited supply of vaccines. But we are hard at work with partners in business, labour and civil society to make this happen. We are working on several fronts to get vaccines, including through the global COVAX facility, the African Union initiative and through our own engagements with vaccine manufacturers. As we act together to overcome the pandemic, we will need to work together to rebuild and transform our economy. We have both the ability and the will to stimulate economic activity, grow our economy and create jobs. And to do so in the midst of a pandemic.Public finances are under extreme strain, now even more so because of the cost of our health response to COVID-19 and the social and economic relief measures we put in place to assist businesses and poor households. The contraction of the economy also meant that tax revenue has declined significantly. There are some parts of the economy that will take longer to recover due to lower global demand generally and restrictions on international travel.That is why we need to be innovative and focused in our plans to rebuild the economy. Significantly, the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan that we announced in October last year is based on broad consensus among all social part ners on the actions needed to rebuild the economy. This lays a firm basis for effective cooperation that draws on the resources, capabilities and energies of all sections of society.We are seeing this in various practical ways. For example, we have been working closely with private funders and multilateral development institutions to prepare infrastructure projects in areas like transport, human settlements, water and telecommunications. Using the Infrastructure Fund as one of the vehicles, we are developing funding models for these projects that draw on several sources in both the public and private sectors. This is particularly important at a time when public finances are limited.The Presidential Employment Stimulus is another example of partnership in action. Understanding that it will take time for economic growth to translate into private sector employment, we have launched the employment stimulus to start creat ing work opportunities now. This programme is being coordinated from the Presiden cy, but is being implemented by a range of government departments and different spheres. Through this programme, tens of thousands of unemployed people are able to both earn and learn as they provide valuable social services.In time, this programme will include a \u2018social employment\u2019 part, where we will partner with other social actors to employ people in a variety of activities \u2013 from improving food security, to tackling gender-based violence to upgrading informal settlements \u2013 that all contribute to the common good. All this work is being reinforced by an aggressive focus on those economic reforms that will have the greatest focus on growth. These include the expansion of electricity generation capacity, making our ports more efficient and competitive, improving access to affordable broadband, and improving turnaround times for water, mining and other licenses. These efforts are being coordinated and monitored jointly by my office and National Treasury. There is much to be done in the year ahead. And we should be in no doubt that we will have to confront many daunting challenges. But we have shown that, as a nation, we are able to suc-ceed when we work together in pursuit of a common pur-pose. If we remember that, and if we put our unity into action, we will ensure that 2021 brings better health and better lives to all our people. I wish you all the best for the new year.

You may feel angry, depressed, inadequate and guilty, but you can overcome these feelings and your anx-iety by educating yourself about the condition.Epilepsy is the tendency to have recurrent seizures, which occur when there is an abnormal electrical discharge in the brain.\nWhy my child?Understanding epilepsy and why seizures occur doesn\u2019t explain why this happened to your child.In approximately 66% of cases, the underlying cause of epilepsy is unknown. This is referred to as idiopathic ep-ilepsy. In the remaining cases the underlying causes can be identified, which is known as symptomatic epilepsy. There can be a variety of underlying causes such as a head injury, that can occur at any age; a birth injury, such as a lack of oxygen during birth; fever convulsions, encephali-tis, meningitis or childhood measles; and metabolic or biochemical disturbances or imbalances.A doctor will prescribe medication based on the age, physical condition and type of seizures your child has.

You are then less likely to pass the virus on to someone else.The aim of vaccination is to reach herd immunity \u2013 when enough of the population is immune to the virus it provides indirect protection to those who aren\u2019t immune, bringing the spread of the virus under control.\nAre vaccines necessary to prevent the spread of COVID-19?There is overwhelming scientific evidence that vaccination is the best defence against serious infections.Will the vaccine stop me from getting COVID-19?No vaccine provides 100% protection. Herd immunity also does not provide full protection to those who are not vaccinated. However, with herd immunity, these people will have substantial protection.\nIs the vaccination safe?COVID-19 vaccines go through a demanding, multi-stage testing process, including large trials that involve tens of thousands of people.Every vaccine used in South Africa\u2019s mass vaccination programme has to be approved by the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority. The Oxford University-AstraZeneca vaccine has already been approved by various regulators around the world and is being rolled out in other countries.\nWho will get the vaccine first?The country\u2019s estimated 1.25 million healthcare workers will receive the vaccine first. In Phase Two, essential workers such as teachers, police, municipal workers, taxi drivers and other frontline personnel; people in institutions such as old age homes, shelters and prisons; and people over 60 and adults with co-morbidities will be prioritised.In Phase Three, about 22.5 million of the remaining adult population will be vaccinated. The target is to vaccinate 67% of the population by the end of 2021. By then we should reach herd immunity.\nWho is purchasing the vaccine?Government is the sole pur chaser of vaccines and will distribute them to provincial governments and the private sector.All those who are vaccinated will be placed on a national register and provided with a vaccination card.", "edition": "2021-02-ed2", "language_code": "eng"}
{"title": "An honour to lead the African Union\n", "author": "Vukuzenzele Unnamed\n", "text": "Ours was a baptism of fire, having assumed the Chair-ship in the same month the first case of coronavirus was reported on the continent.The priorities we outlined for our term, among them furthering peace and security, the economic empowerment of women and deepening economic integration, had to be immediately and dramat-ically reoriented to deal with the pandemic.Our most pressing task was to steer the focus of the African Union to addressing the worst global emergency in over a century.COVID-19 has affected all the countries on the conti-nent. To date there are more than 3.5 million confirmed cases in Africa, and more than 88,000 people have died.It has been a health, human-itarian, social and economic crisis for African countries, most of whom are inade-quately resourced to manage a health emergency of this size.And yet, as unprecedented as the nature of the pandemic has been, so too has been the manner in which African countries have come together to fight it.In doing so we have drawn principally on the continent\u2019s own expertise, capabilities and institutions such as the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Af-rica CDC).Africa did not sit by passive-ly as the true extent and dan-ger of the pandemic unfurled. From the earliest days of the pandemic and led by the AU, we swiftly developed a continental response strategy, driven by the Africa CDC and regional task forces. We realised that every coun-try on the continent would be severely affected by the pan-demic. Most would not have the resources needed to meet the public health challenge or to protect their economies. We therefore agreed as African countries to appoint several prominent Africans as special envoys, who would engage with international funders and multilateral institutions to make the case for financial support and debt relief on Africa\u2019s behalf.In this way, working as a one continent, we were able to achieve debt relief for many countries and financial assistance towards our COVID response and economic recovery.But much as African countries went to the international community for support, we first helped ourselves \u2013 establishing and capitalising a continental COVID-19 Response Fund.For every partnership forged with better-resourced nations and the international donor community, we set up our own innovative and ground-breaking African Medical Supplies Platform to enable all African countries to quickly secure personal protective equipment and other medical supplies in an equitable, affordable manner.And now that the COVID-19 vaccine is available, we have worked as a collective to ensure that the continent gets its fair share, working with the COVAX Facility and led by our own African Vaccine Acquisition Task Team. Vaccine rollout has already commenced on the continent and we aspire to have the majority of the continent\u2019s population vaccinated by the end of 2021 to achieve herd immunity.We have acted as one to protect health, people and livelihoods on the continent. In doing so, we have demonstrated our capacity for self-reliance and our ability to be the drivers of our own development.Despite the dominance of COVID-19, we have still managed to make advances in several of our key priorities.During our term, the Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) was finally launched, heralding a new era of intra-African trade and economic integration.Even under the difficult conditions posed by the pandemic, the continent has pushed ahead with towards the goal of \u2018silencing the guns\u2019 on the continent. The AU has been actively involved in ne-gotiations around the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, in achieving a ceasefire in Libya and promoting peace in South Sudan.Another focus of our term has been on the economic empowerment of women, which we will continue to champion even beyond our term and throughout the Decade of African Women\u2019s Financial and Economic Inclusion to 2030.As we hand over the baton to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) we leave this preeminent continental body in a position of greater strength.South Africa will continue to play its part to foster integration on the continent, and support the incoming Chair and the organisation in its efforts to meet the aspirations of the AU\u2019s Agenda 2063.When the Organisation for African Unity was founded in 1963, Member States planted the seeds of cooperation and solidarity in pursuit of a better life for all the peoples of Africa.They affirmed that African unity was paramount if the welfare and wellbeing of Africa\u2019s people was to be assured.History bears witness that these seeds have not always fallen on fertile ground, and over the years the continental unity project has experienced many hurdles and false starts.But the grave threat posed by this pandemic has galvanised African countries to collective action.In the hot-house of the COVID-19 crisis, the seeds of unity and cooperation planted by our pioneering forebears have come to life and flourished.This time of great trial and difficulty has been among the AU\u2019s finest hours.We are honoured to have been given the opportunity to lead the organisation through this period, when it practically demonstrated the true meaning of the words African Union.\nThis is an accomplishment for which all the citizens of our continent Africa should feel proud and from which they should draw encour-agement.", "edition": "2021-02-ed2", "language_code": "eng"}

Yet, for someone suffering from a gambling addiction, life is far from glamorous. This is according to Lesego Kwanini (34), a marketing consultant from Alexandra, who started gambling in 2010 to escape the stress of her relationship and financial situation.\u201cIt started innocently, taking a chance on the slot machines. It wasn\u2019t long before I was hooked. In one day, I won R50 000. It\u2019s hard to say no to that kind of rush. But in the end, my habit cost far more than I ever won,\u201d says Kwanini.Between 2010 and 2015, Kwanini lost her job, family and friends. \u201cI was lying to the people closest to me, but I didn\u2019t care\u2026 I had my slot machines \u2013 they were my friends.\u201dIt was only a matter of time before those \u2018friends\u2019 turned into enemies. Running out of money to support her gam-bling habit, Kwanini found herself in debt and turned to loan sharks, who she could not pay back. \u201cI was on the verge of suicide,\u201d she admits.While at a casino, Kwanini saw a pamphlet about the South African Responsible Gambling Foundation\u2019s (SARGF) treatment program-me for problem gamblers. She attended the foundation\u2019s free outpatient counselling sessions for three months. \u201cIt was hard. There were many times I felt like gambling, but I stayed strong,\u201d she says.  \u201cI feel blessed now. I\u2019m in a happy place.\u201dAccording to Sibongile Simelane-Quntana, the Executive Director of the SARGF, a problem gambler is someone who continues to gamble despite the negative consequences or impact it has on their life. They also do not want to stop.There are many signs a disordered gambler may exhibit, including being wit-hdrawn, tired and asking for money or loans, she says.\u201cThere are no winners in gambling, only some who lose less,\u201d says psychiatrist Dr Mike West, who practises at Akeso Milnerton.Betting on games of chance or horses is harmless fun for most people but, when people lose control over their gambling habit, it can be as addictive and destructive as using drugs, says Dr West. He advises regular gam-blers to ask themselves the following questions: \u2022 Do you hide the extent of your gambling?\u2022 Do you gamble to escape from problems? \u2022 Are you making larger bets?\u2022 When you are not gam-bling, do you feel irritable or depressed?\u2022 Do you crave gambling or spend a lot of time think-ing about gambling?\u2022 Have you had difficulties in the workplace because of gambling?\u2022 Is your gambling negative-ly affecting your relation-ships?If you answer yes to these questions, Dr West advises an in-depth assessment for a gambling disorder. \n\n\n", "edition": "2021-03-ed1", "language_code": "eng"}
{"title": "\n", "author": "\n", "text": "It will soon be a year since the first reported case of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) in our country. The pandemic has come at a great cost to both public health and the livelihoods of millions of our people.\nMany workers lost part of their income as their work hours were reduced with many being retrenched. Several businesses have incurred heavy losses from scaled-back operations. Others have had to close. People working in the informal sector have also suffered.\nMost difficult of all, the pandemic has claimed the lives of breadwinners in many families, leaving them destitute and fearful for the future.This is why the extensive relief measures we put in place were both necessary and urgent. And, now that nearly a year has passed, we can say that these measures have proved effective.Of the full package of relief measures that we introduced, perhaps the two measures that had the greatest impact were the Special COVID-19 Social Relief of Distress Grant and the Unemployment Insurance Fund's (UIF) COVID-19 Temporary Employer/Employee Relief Scheme, generally known as COVID TERS.We would not have been able to roll out these measures in such a short space of time if we had not had an extensive social security infrastructure already in place. We were able to respond to this huge and immediate need in our society thanks to the substantial nationwide infrastructure and systems of the South African Social Security Agency and the UIF.There were certainly technical and other glitches along the way, but most of these were speedily resolved. These government agencies did outstanding work to enroll millions of new beneficiaries and ensure they were paid. The support provided by the UIF was a lifeline to struggling businesses and employees. It made the difference between companies remaining open and being forced to close, between jobs saved and jobs lost.This benefited businesses like Sihle\u2019s Brew, a restaurant in Gauteng, which was able to retain its 18 employees because of the TERS scheme. Thanks to government support, Mamoshal agae Trading and Projects, an auto-electrical business in Mokopane, was able to pay its workers as well as its rent and rates during the lockdown.Employees in dire straits were able to receive a portion of their salaries.Lindiwe Ntuli, a parale-gal in Centurion, has told how receiving her benefits enabled her to work from home and be able to afford her rent.There are many stories of companies that have been able to stay afloat over the past year because of the support they received from the UIF. The same can be said of the small businesses helped by the various grants and loans provided by a number of departments. These measures greatly helped our people in their time of need.As we transition from relief to recovery, we have to shift gear.While these relief measures were designed to be temporary, the economy will continue to feel the effects of the pandemic for some time.Even as lockdown restrictions have been eased, many companies are struggling to cope with the fallout of months of diminished operations and lost revenue.It is for this reason that, following extensive discussion with social partners at the National Economic Development and Labour Council the COVID TERS benefit has been extended until 15 March 2021 for sectors that have not been able to fully operate.The special COVID grant has been extended for another three months. These remain short-term measures.Our focus now must be on creating an enabling environment for businesses to recover, and for economic growth that spurs job creation and attracts invest ment.The recovery will be difficult and will take time, not least because we are still in the midst of the pandemic.Important as these relief measures are now, we will not be able to sustain them indefinitely. We need to make sure that these relief measures provide a firm foundation for a broader recovery without driving the country deeper into debt. Unless we can bring our national debt down to sustainable levels no meaningful economic recovery will be possible.Our national consciousness must now move beyond the realm of relief into that of recovery, and we must all be part of this effort.As government, hard decisions on public spending will need to be made and implemented this year.Companies will need to be innovative in driving methods and processes that secure their sustainability and profitability, with job retention being their foremost consideration.We must put our money back into our economy by buying local products, supporting local businesses and industrie and procuring from local suppliers.An injured patient with strong prospects for recovery is given regular phys ical therapy to help them get stronger until they can stand unaided.So must these temporary relief measures be seen as the means to get our economy back on its feet. Our ultimate goal is to walk again.As a nation, let us all lend a hand. Let us be part of our own development and progress.Let us use the extended relief to drive a stronger recovery.\n \n\n", "edition": "2021-03-ed1", "language_code": "eng"}
{"title": "A professional public service\n", "author": "Vukuzenzele unnamed\n", "text": " Only a capable, efficient, ethical and development-oriented state can deliver on the commitment to improve the lives of the people of this country.This means that the Public Service  must be staffed by men and women who are professional, skilled, selfless and honest.They must be committed to upholding the values of the Constitution, and must, as I said in my inaugural speech, \u201cfaithfully serve no other cause than that of the public\u201d.Over the past two weeks, public consultations have been underway on an im-portant policy document that will give greater impetus to our efforts to bolster, streng-then and capacitate the civil service.The draft National Imple-mentation Framework to-wards the Professionalisation of the Public Service aims to build a state that better serves our people, that is insulated from undue political inter-ference and where appoint-ments are made on merit.The framework was appro-ved by Cabinet in November last year and structured con-sultation with various sectors of society are now underway.Twenty-seven years into democracy, it can be said of the Public Service that while several pockets of excellence exist, we have serious chal-lenges in many government departments with regards to skills, competence and professionalism.All too often, people have been hired into and promo-ted to key positions for which they are neither suitable nor qualified. This affects go-vernment performance, but also contributes to nepotism, political interference in the work of departments, lack of accountability, mismanage-ment and corruption.There is also the related problem of political and executive interference in the administration of the Public Service. One need only to look at the instability in go-vernment departments when senior managers are swopped or replaced each time a new Minister is appointed.Directors-General (DGs) and provincial heads of departments (HoDs) are particularly affected. In some departments, DGs, HoDs and executive managers have had stability of tenure, enabling the departments to function with little disruption. In most of these departments where there is leadership stability, audit outcomes tend to be positive and public funds can be accounted for. Where there is a high turnover of heads of department, there is often administrative turmoil.One of the key recommen-dations made in the draft framework is that the Public Service must be depoliticised and that government depart-ments must be insulated from politics.Professionalisation is neces-sary for stability in the Public Service, especially in the senior ranks. Public servants must be able to continue doing their jobs \u201cregardless of any changes of Ministers, members of the Executive Council or councillors wit-hin the governing party in charge of the administration, or changes to political parties after elections\u201d.We are proposing a number of far-reaching reforms, such as extending the tenure of HoDs based on merit and performance, doing occupa-tion-based competency as-sessments and involving the Public Service Commission in the interviews of DGs and Deputy DGs.Introducing integrity tests for all shortlisted individu-als will help so that we can recruit civil servants who can serve honestly. We also need to extend the compulsory entrance exams that we intro-duced in April 2020 beyond senior management. Succes-sful developmental states have similar measures which help advance professionalism within the public service.As we note in the draft framework, \u201cthe bureaucracy must continue to loyally and diligently implement the po-litical mandate set by voters and the party, but to refrain from being political actors themselves.\u201dWe are suggesting a more rigorous approach towards recruitment and selection of public servants, induction and performance manage-ment. This includes conti-nuous learning and a clear professional development path for every public servant.The draft Framework puts emphasis on the need to hold public servants accountable for irregularities, to do away with a culture of impunity in the mismanagement and misappropriation of state resources.Professionalising the public service involves training for accounting officers across all spheres of government on the applicable legislative provisions.The National School of Go-vernment (NSG) has a vital role to play in this regard.Professionalism is not only about having the right qualifications and technical skills, but also about having appropriate standards of res-pect, courtesy and integrity in dealing with members of the public.The public service is diverse, with a huge range of skills, qualifications and capabili-ties. Many public servants have specialised skills that are necessary for the effective provision of services. It is therefore not necessarily the case that we need a smaller public service: what we actu-ally need is a fit-for-purpose public service with suitable skills, a professional ethic and a commitment to serving the people.The men and women of the public service need to be capacitated to play their role in driving development and consolidating democracy. This is our best guarantee of a capable state that serves the interests of citizens.I call on you to be part of the public consultation process around this draft framework, which is available on the NSG's website, and to make your voice heard.The Public Service does not belong to any one party, nor should it be the domain of any particular interest group. It should not be a law unto itself.The public service belongs to the people of South Africa. It must serve them and them alone.\n ", "edition": "2021-03-ed2", "language_code": "eng"}

At least 80% of children affected by DS are born from mothers under the age of 35, despite wom-en over the age of 35 being deemed to be at higher risk of having a child with DS.\"She says because the dis-order can be picked up at conception, there are some tell-tale signs to look out for. \"In the early stages of pregnancy, a  1213 week ultrasound scan is advised.This accurately measures the thickness of fluid behind the baby's neck, called the nuchal translucency. This is often larger in babies with DS. Another prenatal test is an amniocentesis. This is when small amounts of amniotic fluid is collected and sent for chromosome analysis. This test is about 98% accu-rate for diagnosis.\"Maluleka says that chil-dren with DS are able to live full, healthy and long lives.  \u201cAlthough there\u2019s no cure, people with DS benefit from loving homes, appropriate medical care, early inter-vention, educational and vocational services. Due to advanced medical care, most people born with DS today have a life expectancy of approximately 55 years. People with DS have the same emotions and needs as any other person and deserve the same oppor-tunities and care,\" says Maluleka.North West-based teacher Tshepo Kekana says, \"Not all special needs students need to go to remedial and special schools.

{"title": "Traditional leaders key to recovery efforts\n", "author": "Vukuzenzele Unnamed\n", "text": "The Zulu people recently laid to rest His Majesty King Goodwill Zwelithini ka Bhe-kuzulu who reigned for half a century. In January, the Ba-pedi people buried Kgoshik-golo Thulare Thulare III, who passed away less than a year after his inauguration.With their passing, we have lost champions of the preservation of our heritage, and revered custodians of the histories of their respective peoples.At the same time, they were vital players in rural develop-ment, and were committed to driving programmes to uplift the material conditions of their people.With the advent of demo-cracy in 1994, it was a prio-rity of the new government to restore the integrity and legitimacy of traditional leadership in line with indi-genous law and customs and subject to the Constitution of the Republic.The institution of traditional leadership continues to play an important role in the lives of millions of people around our country, especially in ru-ral areas. Traditional leaders support and drive develop-ment in their communities.Recently, I had the op-portunity to participate in the debate on the opening of the National House of Traditional Leaders, which was concerned with the most pressing issues currently fa-cing the country.What was particularly refreshing about the robust engagement was that tradi-tional leadership has a keen appreciation of the difficult economic conditions facing our country, and want to be part of addressing the many challenges of underdevelop-ment and poverty in their areas. I have consistently said that our economic recovery in the wake of the Coronavirus pandemic must be inclusive, and that nobody must be left behind. The success of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan rests on forging strong partnerships between not just government, business and la-bour, but also with traditional leadership and other societal formations.A constant refrain from participants in the debate recently was that they do not want to be dependent on handouts or for their com-munities to perpetually look to government for financial assistance.They want to be provided with the necessary support, training and enabling envi-ronment to allow rural com-munities to be self-sufficient.They want to bridge the urban-rural divide in access to government services and private sector resources.What they would like to see is for rural areas to become centres of economic activity, industry and employment opportunity. This mirrors the aspirations of the District Development Model (DDM), which was launched in 2019. Traditional leaders are well positioned to ensure that district plans are informed by and respond to the real needs of communities and that they reflect the lived reality in rural areas.Just as the DDM supports localised programmes that focus on the needs, strengths and opportunities in specific areas, traditional leaders have pioneered their own approach to local economic development.They have developed the InvestRural Masterplan, which was launched in North West last month. It is greatly encouraging that traditional leaders have rallied behind the plan and want to work with local authorities to en-sure it is a success.During the debate in the National House of Traditio-nal Leaders it was proposed that a major success factor for the InvestRural programme is that traditional structures are trained, strengthened and capacitated.A number of participants outlined economic plans that are already in advanced stages of development. These range from agricultural pro-jects to bioprospecting to renewable energy.What was evident is that the institution of traditional leadership understands that professionalisation is neces-sary for rural businesses in the form of small, medium and micro enterprises and cooperatives to become part of the mainstream economy. The traditional leaders who spoke presented their vision of \u2018developmental monarchs\u2019, who see themselves as not just custodians of heritage but also as drivers of econo-mic prosperity and progress. They have identified several projects and economic oppor-tunities that will create jobs and improve livelihoods in rural areas.Traditional leaders have also expressed their willingness to play an active part in the land reform process. Since 2018, traditional leaders have made around 1 500 000 hectares of communal land available for development, and it is hoped this will increase in future.To develop a coordinated and sustainable strategy, we have agreed to hold a Presi-dential Land Summit in the next year. This will discuss pressing issues around land reform and its impact on com-munal land, much of which is located in rural areas.The tone of the debate in the National House was a fitting reflection of a climate in which economic recovery is foremost among our consi-derations. At the same time it was a promising signal that traditional leaders appreci-ate their role in being part of the national recovery effort through being proactive and innovative.The most fitting legacy of great leaders is that the seeds of development they sow during their tenure grow into mighty trees that protect and shelter their communities for posterity.As we work together as a country to rebuild our economy, we will continue to count on the support of the institution of traditional leadership, which is an inex-tricable part of our past, our present and our future.", "edition": "2021-04-ed1", "language_code": "eng"}

Two months later, she started selling the eggs to neighbours. This led to her converting her home garage into a chicken battery house. At the time she also had a backyard vegetable garden.Mhlabane, a former engi-neer, always had plans to leave the corporate world to start her own property busi-ness. In 2014, a while after acquiring her chickens, she bought two hectares of land in Benoni, Gauteng, with the intention to build apartments. However, she couldn\u2019t go through with her plan be-cause the land was demar-cated for agricultural use. She decided to expand her small farming enterprise instead.\nLong processA lack of infrastructure such as fencing, water tanks and electricity meant she only started using the land in 2016.The 49-year-old remembers how she used search engine Google to conduct research on farming. Her baby steps paid off and today, she is the proud owner of Zapa Farm, a successful commercial agricultural en-terprise.

She is one of the many emerging farmers benefitting from the Poultry Master Plan, which was developed by government and industry stake holders, including poultry producers, farmers, processors, exporters, importers and organised labour.Signed in 2019, the plan aims to grow jobs in the industry through a number of measures that will be introduced over the next few years.It was as a result of the plan that the South African Poultry Association (SAPA) paid for Mhlabane\u2019s water use licence and provided her with egg production training.\nSupport for farmersSAPA General Manager Izaak Breitenbach says the industry has invested millions into supporting black farmers and growing poultry production by 5%. In just 12 months, 13 black contract grower farmers were established and 960 jobs were created.\u201cThe industry has invested R870 million to create markets for 50 black contract growers and to facilitate exports to create local jobs. The industry has also done and paid for business studies for 19 black farmers who are in a programme with the Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development,\u201d he says.Forty independent black farmers are also being given poultry-related advice and training. \u201cThe industry also has a database of 670 small, medium and micro enterprise farmers who we assist with relevant information,\u201d he says.In addition, SAPA has made a book available to teach farmers about poultry production and developing their own business plans.Chicken producers have committed to R1.5 billion in fresh investment in their own production facilities withinw the next four years, which should create an additional 4 000 jobs. The industry will also invest R1.7 billion into the establishment of 50 commercial-scale contract farm ers. This investment will be supported by the industry and various government agencies.\n\n", "edition": "2021-04-ed2", "language_code": "eng"}
{"title": "Religious community vital in the fight against COVID-19\n", "author": "Vukuzenzele Unnamed\n", "text": " For the second year, these occasions have been marked in the midst of a devastating global pandemic that has cost the lives of more than 2.5 mil-lion people across the world. Faith-based organisations have been vital to our natio-nal response to the disease, not only providing spiritual comfort and guidance, but also by caring for those most vulnerable to the effects of the pandemic, including through the provision of food, shelter and other social services. Religion plays an important role in the lives of millions of South Africans, and con-gregational worship forms a vital part of their religious practice. Being able to gather for religious services is also a welcome respite from a period of great hardship for individuals, families and communities.It is understandable that after more than a year of labouring under restrictions on religious gatherings that the faith community are keen for a return to a semblance of normality. In recognition of the im-portance of congregational worship to the lives of our people, government has been engaging with the faith com-munity. Leaders of the faith com-munity understand and ap-preciate the very real danger of a new wave of COVID-19 infections. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, religious or-ganisations have taken proac-tive and positive measures to limit the spread of the disease among worshippers. Another important factor is that during the various alert levels, religious organisations have incurred substantial financial losses that threaten their sustainability. As go-vernment we remain commit-ted to working with the faith community to find workable solutions. At the same time, public health and safety must be our paramount consideration.The religious community has shown innovation and initiative in the holding of worship at a time when there was a great deal of uncer-tainty over the trajectory of the pandemic.Congregational services were held online and wor-shippers were encouraged to pray in their homes instead of attending services. This greatly aided the national ef-fort to contain the spread of the disease. Religious leaders played a pivotal role in encouraging public adherence to health measures around important customary and cultural ritu-als like burials. By equal measure, our people have demonstrated their commitment to adhering to public health protocols and to social distancing. And they correctly appreciate that they must continue to avoid large gatherings . We are now at a time where precaution is needed above all. The Coronavirus pande-mic has not been eliminated, either in our own country or around the world. The threat of a third wave is real and ever-present.International experience has taught us that we should not tempt fate. Many countries have eased restrictions, only for there to be resurgences, necessitating the imposition of even harsher restrictions. Large gatherings, whether religious or otherwise, have the potential to spread the virus, despite the application of measures around social distancing and sanitising. Millions of South Africans have been observing an im-portant tenet of their faith. In a country that enshrines the right to religious freedom, all effort must be made to support our people in the exercise of this right. And in exercising this right, we need to make sure that we do not place the rights or the lives of others at risk.  This is a principle that the religious leaders I met with fully support and appreciate. They understand the respon-sibility of all people of faith \u2013 indeed of all South Africans \u2013 to observe the practical measures put in place to protect people\u2019s health and save lives.For more than a year, we have worked together as a society to contain this pan-demic. Now as we work to overcome it, we need to reaffirm our shared determi-nation to act responsibly and cautiously.In doing so, we will be giving practical effect to the universal messages of hope, salvation, freedom and soli-darity that will be spoken of in the churches, synagogues, mosques and homes of our land in the days and weeks ahead.", "edition": "2021-04-ed2", "language_code": "eng"}

{"title": "Port of Durban creates a sea of opportunities for SA\n", "author": "vukuzenzele unnamed\n", "text": "After a briefing with the senior management of Tran-snet, I toured the harbour in a pilot boat, which is usu-ally used to guide large ships through the entrance channel to the pier. Seeing the workings of the port from the water, one is reminded of its vast scale and complexity. If the port does not function efficiently, the entire econo-my suffers, from importers and exporters to consumers.  On the other hand, if the port works well it can drive economic growth and position our country as a ga-teway to the region and the continent. When I visited Durban in October 2019, many local businesses and port users raised concerns with me about the performance of the Durban Port. Shipping companies, in particular, expressed concern about truck congestion and waiting times, ship berthing delays and anchorage times, poor maintenance of equi-pment and generally low productivity in the port. My recent visit to the port was to check whether the commitments made in res-ponse to these concerns had been implemented.There has indeed been great progress over the past year in turning around the per-formance of the port, despite the impact of COVID-19.These efforts are already showing results in improved maintenance of equipment, reduced congestion, quicker turnaround times and incre-ased use of rail instead of road transport. While this is important pro-gress, there is still much work to be done to position Durban as a world-class port and as a hub port for the Southern Hemisphere. In recent years, the port has slipped from its position as first in Africa to third, behind Tangier in Morocco and Port Said in Egypt.  Truck turnaround times have greatly improved. Similarly, the reliability of cargo handling equipment has improved to 80% and is heading towards at least 95% to meet international bench-marks. Ship waiting times have reduced to impressive levels.These statistics may seem technical and obscure, but they have a direct impact on the growth of our economy and on the prices we pay as consumers. We have made improving the efficiency of our ports a priority of Operation Vul-indlela and have focused on rebuilding Transnet, which is one of our valued state-owned enterprises.The new management of Transnet and its operating di-visions are resolutely focused on turning the performance of the port around.The management has ambi-tious and exciting expansion plans for all five of the port\u2019s precincts. These include the deepening of the Maydon Wharf channel to allow larger, modern ves-sels to enter the port, the infill of Pier 1 and Pier 2 to create additional capacity for con tainers and the development of a new container terminal in the Point Precinct. Altogether, the expansion of infrastructure at the port will require R100 billion in new investment over the next decade and more. This will completely transform the port, expanding its capacity for container handling from 2.9 million units to more than 11 million units.These ambitious plans will require greater private sector participation and investment. Transnet, including the Durban Port, is an important national asset belonging to the people of South Africa. Partnerships with the private sector are crucial to bring new investment, technology and expertise to port operations and to modernise equipment and infrastructure. Transnet is planning, for example, to advertise a concession later this year to build and operate the new Point Terminal. This will bring in private investment and improve the efficiency of container handling. Through our reform process we are steadily improving the efficiency of our ports and railways and unlocking massive investment in infrastructure. This will not only lower costs and improve the competitiveness of our exports, but will create thousands of new jobs in the process.Through both operational improvements and structural reforms, Durban Port will reclaim its place as the best-performing port in Africa. As part of our Reconstruction and Recove ry Plan, we will continue to work tireles-sly to expand infrastructure investment and transform our network industries. If my visit to Durban left one thing in my mind, it is that we South Africans are capable of succeeding in projects of vast importance and scale.  Our ambitions should match the size of our challenges. With the progress we are making at the Durban Port, with the reinvigorated skills and capabilities that we have in Transnet, we now have the wind in our sails. And we are moving at a rate of knots towards our destination.", "edition": "2021-05-ed1", "language_code": "eng"}
{"title": "Robust media more critical than ever\n", "author": "Vukuzenzele unnamed\n", "text": "We have come a long way from the days where social protest by artists attracted banning orders, and critical reporting by journalists risked imprisonment or the closure of publications.Recently, the organisation Reporters without Borders published the 2021 World Press Freedom Index, a ba-rometer of the state of media freedom across the globe.Overall, it was found that there has been a decline in public access to information and an increase in obstacles to news coverage in a number of countries. The report said that jour-nalism is \u201ctotally blocked or seriously impeded\u201d in 73 countries and \u201cconstrained\u201d in 59 others. What is worrying is that media freedom has deterio-rated under the COVID-19 pandemic, with the various restrictions put in place having seemingly been used to curtail media activity in several places.In this latest report South Africa ranked 32nd out of 180 countries. The index describes the state of media freedom in South Africa as \u201cguaranteed but fragile\u201d. It notes that while the South African Constitution protects freedom and we have an established culture of investigative journalism, a number of impediments still hinder journalists in the performance of their duties. This includes legal injunc-tions against taking images of National Key Points or re-porting on matters involving state security. The report also notes an increase during 2020 of the intimidation of journalists, especially female journalists on social media. Such intimidation is totally unacceptable, but is par-ticularly harmful when it is directed at female journalists and is occasionally accom-panied by threats of sexual violence. This is a matter of great concern and cannot be allowed.At the same time, we take great comfort in the knowl-edge that we have a free, robust media that is able to report without fear or favour about those in power, about the most pressing social issues of our time, and to provide accurate, impartial information to the public.At a time when we are working together to rebuild our economy and our society in the midst of the Coronavi-rus pandemic, a robust media is more critical than ever. The South African media has played a pivotal role in uncovering much of what we know today about the true extent of capture of the state by self-serving, corrupt individuals and entities.They sustained their re-porting even in the face of intimidation, disinformation and attacks on their person.Corruption is by no means the only challenge we face as a country. The daily lives of many South Africans are still affected by poverty, inequal-ity and underdevelopment, poor service delivery and lack of access to opportunities. If the media is to remain true to its responsibility to support democracy, our journalists must continue to report without fear or favour on the other issues of the day. Their sustained coverage must include gender-based violence, crime in our com-munities and social ills like substance abuse. Our media should provide accurate and impartial infor-mation, enabling the public to make informed decisions, to access opportunities and to improve their lives. They should continue to produce journalism that goes beyond the headlines and front pages and that contrib-utes to human development. They should report both the good news and the bad news, the progress we make and the challenges we face. Credibility is key to sustain-ing trust between journalists and the public. When journalists allow themselves or their platforms to be used to fight political battles or settle scores on be-half of vested interests, their credibility suffers. When media disseminate stories that are inaccurate or that they know to be false, the public loses faith in them. It is in the best interests of all who love this country and wish for it to succeed that our media is supported, and not hindered in its work.  As a society, let us continue to work together to jealously safeguard our country\u2019s me-dia freedom.

{"title": "Tobacco addiction: Your health could go up in smoke\n", "author": "Kgaogelo Letsebe \n", "text": "Katlego Makhanda, from Moiletswane in the North West, knows all too well how hard it is to stop smoking.  Until he stopped four years ago, Makhanda (28) used to smoke over 30 cigarettes a day.  He started smoking when he was 18 as a result of peer pressure.\u201cI was not interested in smoking \u2013 it didn\u2019t appeal to me until I was in matric and a group of guys I used to hang out with started picking on me for not being cool enough to smoke.\u201d Makhanda initially smoked one or two cigarettes a day, but this increased over time.\u201cAfter matric, I went to varsity and the freedom that came with not staying with my parents meant I could drink alcohol as frequently as I wanted. This increased my rate of smoking.\u201d In 2017, Makhanda fell ill and was hospitalised. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and for weeks was too weak to get out of bed. \u201cThe doctor was very specific that managing my illness couldn\u2019t be done if I continued to smoke. That is when I decided to quit for good.\u201dDr Midah Maluleke from Mpumalanga says smoking is harmful to nearly every organ.\u201cIllnesses such as cancer, heart disease, stroke, lung diseases, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease can result from smoking. \u201cResearch shows that smokers are 30% to 40% more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than non-smokers. Smoking also creates difficulty in managing the disease,\u201d he says.\nTips to stop smokingThe Cancer Association of South Africa (CANSA) offers the following tips if you are trying to stop smoking:  Decide on a date to stop smoking and then do it.  Throw away everything that reminds you of smoking. This includes cigarette packets, ashtrays, lighters. Drink lots of water \u2013 it will help flush the nicotine from your body.  Inform your family and friends that you are trying to stop so that they can support you.  You may experience some dizziness, headaches or coughing once you have stopped smoking. This is normal and should improve after a day or two and disappear within 14 days.Makhanda says his journey hasn\u2019t been easy, but he is committed to not smoking.\u201cThe local clinic and staff provided me with support and information on the importance of living a tobacco-free life.

{"title": "Israel, Palestine urged to emulate SA by pursuing peace\n", "author": "vukuzenzele unnamed\n", "text": " The escalating situation in Israel and Palestine affirms once more what we South Africans know too well, that intractable conflicts can only be solved through peaceful negotiation.  It also demonstrates that unless the root causes of a conflict are addressed, in this case the illegal occupation by Israel of Palestinian land and the denial of the Palestinian people\u2019s right to self-determination, there will never be peace.The latest violence was sparked by an Israeli court decision to evict a group of families from their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood in East Jerusalem to make way for Israeli settlements. The sight of men, women and children being evicted from the homes their families have lived in for generations brings back painful collective and personal memories for the majority of South Africans \u2013 of forced removals and land dispossession. It was a pain and humiliation faced by my own family, and by many South African families. My family was forcibly moved to different parts of the country on two occasions.  Being forced from one\u2019s home at gunpoint is a trauma not easily forgotten and is carried across generations. As a country, we are still living with the residual effects of the callous acts carried out in the name of apartheid spatial planning.For all who believe in equality, justice and human rights, we cannot but be moved and indeed angered, at the pain and humiliation being inflicted on the Palestinian people; for it echoes our own. Israel\u2019s actions are a violation of international law. They show a total disregard for successive United Nations Security Council reso lutions that call for an end to the occupation of Palestinian land and for the fulfilment of the rights of the Palestinian people.  Since Israeli security forces launched assaults on worshippers at Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, the violence has now engulfed the Gaza Strip, large parts of the West Bank and a number of Israeli cities. It has claimed the lives of dozens of people, including children. It is also deeply troubling that Israeli forces destroyed a multi-storey building that housed a number of media organisations, sending a chilling message to media reporting on the violence.The senseless and continued Israeli bombardment of Gaza will have devastating consequences for more than two million people who have been suffering under an illegal Israeli blockade for 14 years. We call on all parties involved to show restraint, to respect human life and to cease the current hostilities. As South Africa, we are committed to being part of international efforts aimed at reviving a political process that will lead to the establishment of a viable Palestinian state existing side-by-side in peace with Israel and within internationally recognised borders.  The two-state solution remains the most viable option for the peoples of Israel and Palestine and must continue to be supported. Just as Israeli security forces were attacking worshippers at the Al-Aqsa Mosque, we in South Africa were preparing to commemorate the centenary of the Bulhoek Massacre at a religious site in Ntabelanga in the Eastern Cape. On 24 May 1921, colonial security forces armed with machine guns and artillery opened fire on worshippers, killing more than 160 people and wounding nearly 130. The massacre laid bare the brutality not only of the police force of the Union of South Africa, but also the racist system that it was charged to uphold.Just like the dispute in the Sheik Jarrah neighbourhood, the atrocity at Bulhoek was not just about a local dispute; it was fundamentally about the forced dispossession of land, about colonial occupa tion, about racial discrimi nation and about the violent suppression of dissent.As we reflect on the crisis in the Middle East and particularly on the suffering of the Palestinian people, we would do well to recall the words of Selby Msimang, a founding member of the African National Congress.In the aftermath of the Bulhoek massacre he wrote: \u201cHistory has shown that the human soul naturally revolts against injustice\u201d. The protests and the revolt of the oppressed people of South Africa against colonialism and apartheid proved the veracity of this prophecy. As lovers of freedom and of justice, we stand with the Palestinian people in their quest for self-determination, but also in their resistance against the deprivation of their human rights and the denial of their dignity. As citizens of a country that was able to turn its back on race-hatred and bloodshed, and build an inclusive socie-ty rooted in human rights for all, it is our collective hope that the people of Israel and Palestine will follow a similar path; that they will find each other and that they will find peace.", "edition": "2021-06-ed1", "language_code": "eng"}

Mavhunga over-dosed on prescription pills after the video of the beating was shared on social media. Cyber security experts from the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) say cyberbullying is ex-tremely harmful to children and can lead to depression, sadness, anger, frustration, anxiety and fear.\u201cIt can also lead to low self-esteem, delinquency, school violence, family prob-lems and suicidal thoughts,\u201d explains CSIR senior re-searcher Sipho Ngobeni. Cyberbullying occurs when someone uses electronic com-munication to intentionally harass, threaten, embarrass, intimidate, stalk, humiliate or make fun of another person.Ngobeni says research shows that 41% of children develop social anxiety after experiencing cyberbullying, 37% develop depression, 26% have suicidal thoughts and 25% engage in self-harm.\u201cThese findings show that cyberbullying is a serious issue... Getting everyone involved \u2013 youth, parents, educators, law enforcement and social media companies \u2013 is the key to dealing with this problem,\u201d he adds. Most cyberbullying, 42%, occurs on Instagram, 31% on Facebook, 31% on Snapchat, 12% on WhatsApp, 10% on YouTube and 9% on Twitter.CSIR expert Rofhiwa Net-shiya says there is a need for public education about all forms of cyberbullying. \u201cWe need to educate chil-dren that cyberbullying can lead to serious consequenc-es,\u201d she says.To tackle cyberbullying, the CSIR team is working on a platform that detects bullying in chatrooms.\u201cThe platform will automat-ically detect cyberbullying on chat groups and block users who continue to send hate speech. It will give the user three warning messages and, if they persist, it will block them,\u201d says Netshiya. She advises parents to install basic internet mon-itoring software on their children's devices to monitor their activities. \u201cThere are low-cost prod-ucts that can invisibly moni-tor the activities of your kids and privately email you the results as often as you like. These are very important to track internet sites visit-ed, downloads, chatroom conversations and instant messaging.\u201dThe CSIR offers the follow-ing tips for parents who sus-pect their children are victims of cyberbullying:\n\u2022 Ensure the child feels safe, show unconditional sup-port.\u2022 Work with your child to arrive at a course of action that you both agree on.\u2022 Discuss the cyberbullying matter with the relevant school.\u2022 Contact parents of the ag-gressor to investigate the matter and remove offend-ing material.\u2022 Report the issue to police in the case of physical threats or extortion, stalk-ing, blackmail and the sex-ual exploitation of minors.\u2022 Educate your child about appropriate online behav-iour.\u2022 Reinforce positive morals and values.\n", "edition": "2021-06-ed1", "language_code": "eng"}

It is the vision that this community has spent the past 25 years fighting to see realised,\u201d said the President at the handover ceremony.The farmers have been successfully farming various agricultural produce on the land since 1996.They organised themselves in the 1990s to be registered commercial farmers under the banner of the Tafelkop Farmers Association and started to engage government.In 2000, the then National Department of Agriculture entered into lease agreements with the Tafelkop Farmers Association in terms of the Land Redistribution for Agricultural Development Programme.In 2009, the former Limpopo Department of Agri culture recommended to the Department of Public Works that the land be transferred to the farmers. The deeds were registered in the names of the farmers earlier this year.The land is currently being used to farm tobacco, cotton and fresh produce.Thirty-two households are supported by the land and farming activities which provide employment to 128 permanent workers and up to 320 seasonal workers. Justice for the communityThe President said the com munity had endured many hardships over the years and the \u201ctitle deeds bring justice to a dispossessed community\u201d. \u201cWe have not forgotten the dispossession, land theft and forced removals that the people of this community and many communities across the country had to endure.  \u201cWe have not forgotten the harsh legacy of farming here in Limpopo, where farm-dwellers were forced to be labour tenants on their forefathers\u2019 land and not allowed to own land to feed their families or graze their animals.\u201d He added that black farmworkers were exploited and abused in what was previously the Northern Transvaal.\u201cWe also recall how the apartheid government supported white farmers with equipment, technical support and access to credit to build their businesses, but black subsistence farmers struggled to survive.\u201dTransforming the agricultural industryThe President said the trans fer of land inspires hope because it shows that with the right support and opportunities, the agricultural industry can be transformed for the benefit of the country. \u201cWe celebrate our progress, because day by day our Land Reform Programme is gaining momentum.  \u201cTo date, government has redistributed over five million hectares of land, to-talling around 5 500 farms, to more than 300 000 beneficiaries.\u201d So far, the land restitution process has benefited over two million land claimants and resulted in the transfer of around 2.7 million hectares.\u201cLand reform isn\u2019t just in the interests of redress, justice and social cohesion. It is also about economic development. Agriculture and the agriculture value chain can and must transform rural economies,\u201d said President Ramaphosa.Government plans to establish a land and agrarian reform agency to fast-track land reform.\u201cWe are looking at how effective our past policies have been. We are going to address this issue of land reform urgently.\u201dAddressing past mistakesThe President said govern ment was working hard to correct what went wrong during the apartheid years and since the start of de mocracy. \u201cWe do this in tribute to those who lived among us; who resided here.\u201dLand reform is vital to improving the country\u2019s food security, building an inclusive economy and providing a better future for all South Africans, added the President.He urged the Tafelkop farmers to use the land wisely and for the benefit of the community.\u201cFor me, today has been the best day in the office; to kick the soil and dust and see your produce. \u201cI have no doubt that with the commitment and energy of all involved, this project will continue to thrive,\u201d he said.Chairperson of the Tafelkop Farmers Association Jerry Sefoloshe thanked government for making it possible for the farmers to become the owners of the land they have worked for decades.  \nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa with farmers from Tafelkop, Limpopo, who recently received title deeds for the land they farm.", "edition": "2021-06-ed2", "language_code": "eng"}

The Constitution of the apartheid republic pledged allegiance to God, \u201cwho gath-ered our forebears together from many lands and gave them this as their own\u201d.It was a Constitution written by and for a racial minority, and it used faith to justify tyranny. It outlined the ad-ministration of government, providing that only white people were eligible to vote and serve as public represent-atives. It contained no Bill of Rights.

We live in a country where everyone has the right to approach the courts for the fulfilment of their rights.  We live in a country where communities can stake a le-gal claim on land they were forcefully moved from, and where individuals or fam-ilies are protected against arbitrary eviction from their homes.  We live in a country where everyone is permitted to freely practise their culture and traditions. It is a country where anyone can freely protest in support of social, political and other causes anywhere.Our constitutional dispensa-tion is premised on account-able government, where the Executive is answerable to the people and where Parlia-ment is representative of the people. It is a country where the law applies equally to any citizen. We now have a government of the people, for the people and by the people.When the apartheid regime triumphantly paraded its racist Constitution to the world 60 years ago, it had misplaced confidence that it would endure.In an unanswered letter to Verwoerd a month before the republic was declared, Nelson Mandela affirmed the liberation movement\u2019s rejec-tion of the forcibly imposed white republic. He said that no Constitution or form of government decid-ed without the participation of the African people would enjoy moral validity. Indeed no system that en-trenches the systematic de-nial of people\u2019s rights can be sustained. Though it would be over three decades before the demands of the liberation movement were met, we eventually won our freedom.  In relegating the apartheid Constitution to the dustbin of history, we committed our-selves to a new Constitution and a new set of values.  When I addressed the Constitutional Assembly 25 years ago, I said our Con-stitution must become more than words on a page; it must become a reality in the lives of our people. Unless we do so, this pro-gressive and revolutionary document will be rendered irrelevant and meaningless. We have long decided what kind of society we want to be. It is a society rooted in human dignity, equality, freedom and non-discrimination. For a quarter of a century we have worked to build such a society. We have made undeniable progress, but we still have many challenges and there is much work still to be done.  As we mark the anniver-sary of the adoption of our democratic Constitution, let us remember what a decisive break it was with the system underpinned by racism, ex-ploitation, dispossession and oppression that had come before. Let us also remember that it is up to us to make the vision contained in our Constitution a reality. For it is only by ensuring that all South Africans are able to freely and fully ex-ercise their constitutional rights, that we will truly become a united people.\n", "edition": "2021-06-ed2", "language_code": "eng"}

This is extremely dangerous. \u2022 Do not let children play near paraffin or gas lamps or heaters. \u2022 Do not hold a child while cooking or leave children unsupervised in or near the kitchen.\u2022 Ensure the kettle is out of reach. Buy a cordless kettle if you can.\u2022 Do not carry urns or pots of boiling water around near children.\u2022 Turn pot handles away from the front of the stove.\u2022 Put candles in a deep glass bottle with sand at the bottom so that they will go out if they fall over.\u2022 Do not cover fires with sand. The heat stays in the sand for hours. \u2022 Put cold water in the bath first, and then add hot water. Always test the bath water with your elbow first.If you sustain a burn injury involving flames, stop, drop to the ground and roll to put out the flames.\u201cHeat from a fire, hot water or electrical burn will continue to burn the tissue long after the contact is removed. \u201cStop the burning by keeping the burnt body part under cold running tap water for 20 minutes.

{"title": "The youth are our greatest asset\n", "author": "vukuzenzele unnamed\n", "text": " On that day and in the days that followed, many lost their lives. They were killed by a callous regime that had little regard for black lives and thought nothing of opening fire on unarmed, uniformed schoolchildren.  These events hardened international opinion against the apartheid regime and gave further impetus to the liberation struggle.Young people have always been at the forefront of social protest, from the anti-au-thoritarian protests in Latin America in the late 1950s, to the protests across Africa in the late 1960s. History faithfully records the contribution of the gen-eration of 1976 to the interna-tional student movement and its stance against oppression and injustice. This historic event 45 years ago continues to be commem-orated across Africa and the world. It is therefore disturbing that knowledge of June 16th is diminishing among young South Africans. This is particularly so among the so-called Generation Z, or young people born between 1997 and 2015. The 2019/2020 South Afri-can Social Attitudes Survey published by the Human Sciences Research Council found that close to 40% of Generation Z has not heard of the historical events of June 16th. A similar percentage has heard about it but knows very little or nothing about it.  Nevertheless, the survey also found that young people of this generation are open to learning about key historical events and believe in their continued importance.  We need to do more as a country to ensure that the message of 1976 is transmit-ted faithfully.  This is a collective responsi-bility of government, schools, tertiary institutions, parents, families, musicians, artists, and all of society.  The generation that was born after apartheid ended inherited a country with a democratic Constitution and where fundamental freedoms are protected.The opportunities young black people have today are both vastly different and greatly improved. Keeping the story of June 16th alive is a reminder to to-day\u2019s generation of the great sacrifices made to secure their freedom. Youth Day is a reminder of the immense power and agency that young people have to create a better future for themselves. The struggles of young people in South Africa today are many. Young people have remained at the forefront of activism, whether in pursuit of free education or against social ills like gender-based violence. Today the greatest struggle young people wage is against unemployment, which has worsened under the COV-ID-19 pandemic.  Creating more opportuni-ties for young people, and access to these opportunities, is government\u2019s foremost priority. Everything that we do as a government contributes towards improving the lives of young people. Tackling youth unemploy-ment requires accelerating economic growth, particular-ly in labour-intensive sectors, and building the capability of the state to fulfil its develop-mental role. We are also driving this agenda through targeted interventions. These include the Presidential Employment Stimulus, which has provid-ed work opportunities and livelihoods support for many young people. We have launched a range of additional measures to create opportunities, enhance skills development, support young entrepreneurs and enable the full participation of young people in the econ-omy.This includes the establish-ment of a National Pathway Management Network, SA Youth, to make it easier for young people to view and access opportunities and re-ceive active support to find pathways into the labour market. These are among the priori-ties of the Presidential Youth Employment Intervention, which was launched just weeks before we entered a national lockdown last year and which is now entering full implementation.The Presidential Youth Em-ployment Intervention was built on the understanding that addressing the youth un-employment crisis requires innovative thinking and strong partnerships across society. Its ultimate objective is to find models that work, whether in skills develop-ment or active labour market policies, and to scale these rapidly to reach as many young people as possible.Most importantly, it recog-nises that young people must be at the centre of any effort to boost youth employment. Young people are our great-est asset, and our greatest weapon in this fight.We salute the resilience of every young person playing their part to build and devel-op this country. They are the young people volunteering in our commu-nities, building our country through the Presidential Employment Stimulus, run-ning their own businesses and studying to better them-selves.They are the young people who are forging their own path and bringing their fam-ilies along with them.We salute young people who keep working to im-prove their lives. Young people are doing their part; they need government, and indeed all of society, to do ours.Our country is going through the most difficult of times, but we are working daily to expand the frontiers of hope. We are seeing the green shoots of growth in our economy, and are confident this will translate to better opportunities for all. Our task now is to ensure that young people are ready and able to access these opportunities, and to create their own.\n", "edition": "2021-07-ed1", "language_code": "eng"}
{"title": "SOEs must drive  economic growth  and transformation\n", "author": "vukuzenzele unnamed\n", "text": "In addition to needing regular bailouts from government, some of the country\u2019s biggest and most important state-owned com-panies have been struggling to meet their mandates. These SOEs should be at the forefront of economic and social transformation. They are responsible for providing the infrastructure and the services on which the economy depends, whether it be in the generation of elec-tricity, commuter transport, water provision, freight logis-tics or telecommunications.Our approach to state ownership is informed by the need for the effective functioning of key network industries, such as energy and ports, and by the need to ensure that the basic needs of all South Africans, particu-larly the poor, can be met. We firmly believe that public ownership is neces-sary in critical sectors of the economy and that the coun-try needs robust SOEs that are able to drive economic growth and transformation.This is particularly the case in the delivery of public goods such as electricity and water, where SOEs are able to pursue a developmental mandate in the public interest as opposed to a purely commercial one.That is why we have made it a priority of this government to turn these companies around to root out corruption, improve their governance and enable them to play the role they should in driving economic growth and employment creation.To this end, we have embarked upon a number of reforms to strengthen these SOEs so that they can produce the results that the country needs and expects. One of the most important reforms is in the energy sector. We have begun the process of restructuring Eskom into three different SOEs, responsible for gen-eration, transmission and distribution, respectively. This is because the previous structure of Eskom was ill-suited for a changing ener-gy landscape. It had become inefficient and costly and was not sufficiently transparent. The establishment of a trans-mission entity in particular will mean that Eskom will be able to purchase power from a broader range of providers, both private and public. This will improve transparency, increase competitiveness and promote the purchase of lowest-cost electricity. Through the Renewable Energy Independent Pow-er Producers Programme, there has been significant private investment in en-ergy generation. With the proposal to raise the licenc-ing exemption for embedded generation \u2013 where compa-nies produce electricity for themselves and other com-mercial users \u2013 from 1MW to 100MW, we can expect even more private investment. This is vital at a time when the country is suffering from severe and sustained electricity shortages and where neither Eskom nor the state is able to invest in new generation capacity.Importantly, these reforms will give Eskom the space to address its financial and operational challenges.Another critical reform is the establishment of the National Ports Au-thority as an independent subsidiary of Transnet.This a crucial part of Trans-net\u2019s broader strategy to revi-talise our logistics infrastruc-ture. Transnet plans to invest R100 billion over the next five years in upgrading its infra-structure across the ports sys-tem. This will make our ports more efficient and our ex-ports more competitive, and benefit the entire economy.For the ordinary consumer, it will mean reduced prices in the long term for many of our goods. For our exporters, it will mean greater compet-itiveness in global markets.As our exports grow, our economy will expand and create more jobs. More efficient ports will make the entire economy work better \u2013 and as port volumes increase, jobs will be created at the ports themselves.Establishing the National Ports Authority as a Trans-net subsidiary with its own board will, among other things, mean that revenues generated by the ports can be used to replace old equipment and upgrade and expand our ports, work which has been delayed for more than a decade.  Among other things, these reforms will encourage great-er private investment in the country\u2019s economic infra-structure. Some people have expressed concerns that this will diminish the importance or reduce the value of SOEs. In fact, the contrary is true.  These reforms will ensure that while strategic infra-structure remains firmly in state hands, our SOEs will become more efficient and the industries they support will become more competi-tive. Equally, these reforms are important to ensure that SOEs implement their broader developmental mandates to support all citizens and the economy. Our policy remains that SOEs must play a crucial developmental role in sup-porting the growth of our economy. Our task is to place them on a sound foot-ing, so that they can serve their ultimate shareholders \u2013 the South African people.\n", "edition": "2021-07-ed2", "language_code": "eng"}

To my surprise, I was told I did not qualify. \u201cI initially thought it was because of my unstable income, but it wasn\u2019t. I knew I only had one clothing account and no other debt, so I asked for a printout of my profile,\u201d he says. Mabitsela saw that two cellphone contracts, a R65 000  bank loan and numerous re tail shop accounts had been opened in his name. The debt was close to R100 000. \u201cJust before the national level 5 lockdown, I lost my ID book.

They pro vided a firm foundation for the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan that we launched in October last year.\nAs part of that plan, we introduced the Presidential Employment Stimulus to provide income and livelihood support to millions of beneficiaries.\nThrough the stimulus, over 300 000 young people have been placed as school assistants. More than 100 000 subsistence farmers are registered on the first-ever database of its kind where they have access to technical support. More than 30 000 young people have been given opportunities in the cultural, creative and sports sectors.\nYoung professionals have been given opportunities in infrastructure development, healthcare, environmental conservation and a number of other sectors.\nThere are promising indi cations that our economy is steadily recovering, with growth and job creation in a number of sectors, from manufacturing to mining to agriculture. At the same time we know that this \u2018bigger picture\u2019 is cold comfort to workers and business owners who have suffered immeasurably over the past year and a half, and were hoping to see their situa tions improve as the economy slowly opened up.The rapid rise in infections being fueled by the new Delta variant necessitated the imposing of tighter restric tions on the movement of persons, on the operation of certain businesses and on public gatherings, among others.\nThese were not been easy decisions to make, mindful of their impact on people\u2019s livelihoods.Just as we did at the beginning of the pandemic, we engaged in deliberations with all social partners, business, labour and civil society to see what financially sustainable measures we could intro duce to support businesses and individuals in distress at this time.\nThe negotiations at the National Economic Development and Labour Council resulted in consen sus that the most practical and financially sustainable measure that can provide urgent relief is extending the COVID19 TERS scheme to sectors that have been affected by the adjusted level 4 restrictions.\nTo support businesses whose operating licenses and per mits expired between March 2020 and June 2021, we are extending their validity until 31 December 2022.\nIn addition, new business licenses or permits that are issued from the 1 July will also be valid until 31 December 2022, and no license fee will be payable.Over the past year, we have also been working consist ently to protect vulnerable workers whose jobs were at risk, particularly in hard-hit sectors like retail, food and beverage and the metals industry.\nThrough processes facili tated by the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration, some 58 000 jobs have been saved.\nWith the pandemic show ing no immediate signs of ending, businesses and work ers remain vulnerable.\nIt is thanks to the social com pacts we continue to forge that government, business and labour have been able to work together to buffer work ers and businesses from the pandemic\u2019s harsh economic impacts.\nFor now, our priority is saving lives, and ensuring that we provide the necessary support, within our means, to prevent more businesses closing down and more jobs being lost.As we did with the COVID19 TERS scheme, government is firmly committed to con tinue its engagements with business and labour to find a way through these distressing times that both saves lives and protects livelihoods.", "edition": "2021-08-ed1", "language_code": "eng"}

{"title": "Help learners cope with COVID-19\n", "author": "vukuzenzele unnamed\n", "text": "More Matshediso Learners have been faced with many challenges as a result of the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) and the lockdown restrictions.\nThere has been constant change in the learning envi-ronment at South Africa\u2019s schools, which can leave learners feeling anxious and fearful.Learners have had to navigate a new world of online or delayed learning, social isolation, loss, grief and trauma, all of which can cause increased anxiety and depression.Counselling psychologist Boitumelo Tlhapane, who works for the Inclusive Education Unit at the Free State Department of Edu-cation, says feeling anxious or depressed during these trying times is understan-dable. \u201cFor about a-year-and-a-half now, learners have had to adjust to a new way of learning, with less contact and teaching time. \u201cMany have had to study independently, while living with uncertainty about their future and the impact of COVID-19 on their hopes and dreams, family and social life,\u201d says Tlhapane. How to cope She explains that anxiety is the fear of or worrying about something that has an uncertain outcome. To help learners to cope, she offers the following advice: \u2022 Understand that it is nor-mal to be anxious or fear-ful. This does not mean that you are weak. It is okay to not be okay. \u2022 What you do with your fear is what is important. Are you obeying all the COVID-19 rules that have put in place to protect you and others? What else can you do to ensure your and others\u2019 safety? \u2022 Do you have reliable infor-mation about COVID-19 in case you or a loved one gets infected? \u2022 Do you have the support of teachers, family and friends to help you when you feel uncertain or stressed or anxious? This is very important. Teachers can also provide non-contact support and learning through online material and study groups; by setting up reminders to motivate learners to study at home; and by encoura-ging them to communicate their fears about schooling. \u201cThis is important, espe-cially for subjects that learners find challenging,\u201d she adds.Family and friends can provide learners with emotional support, in the form of encouragement and constant reassurance, says Tlhapane. \u201cLearners need to be constantly reminded that their efforts and dedication are recognised and appre-ciated, thus increasing their confidence.\u201dHow to reduce anxietyTlhapane says there are various ways that parents and learners can reduce anxiety. These include:\n\u2022 Ensure that there is a strict routine for studying, sleep-ing and socialising. This will help learners meet their goals and deadlines, while helping them to feel in control of their studies. \u2022 Learners must use all of the available resources provided at school and on educational programmes, in line with the curricu-lum, that are broadcast on television and radio.\u2022 Parents can assist by en-suring that learners are not overexposed to COVID-19 news, especially around death and conspiracy the-ories, as this may fuel their fears and lead to more psy-chological conditions. \u2022 Learners should limit so-cial media consumption, as it wastes study time and is a major distraction. \u2022 The family can adapt their lifestyle by adding self-care tasks, such as physical exercise and play. \u201cIf a learner loses a loved one, they may experience grief symptoms that resem-ble depression or anxiety. \u201cIt is important that the school and the parents refer these learners for psycho-social support, which is provided by the Depart-ment of Basic Education, or consult free resources or local clinics for a referral,\u201d says Tlhapane.Signs of distress Parents should be alert and watch for various signs that may indicate that their child is in distress. These include:\n\u2022 The child being withdrawn and isolating from others.\u2022 Irregular eating and sleep patterns. \u2022 Being overly emotional, such as constantly crying, irritable moods or losing their temper quickly.\u2022 Struggling to concentrate.\u2022 Not completing tasks and homework.\u2022 Behavioural problems, such as aggressiveness.\u2022 Making up excuses not to go to school. \u2022 Constantly on the phone or social media networks.\u2022 Fails to complete other tasks of daily living.\nFor assistance, parents and  learners can visit the department\u2019s district offices.  You can also  contact the South African Depression and Anxiety Group, at 0800 567 567 or send an SMS to 31393 and a  counsellor will  call you back.", "edition": "2021-08-ed2", "language_code": "eng"}
{"title": "Inclusive communities critical to SA\u2019s success\n", "author": "vukuzenzele unnamed\n", "text": "This was most evident in the tragic events that took place in and around Phoe-nix in eThekwini. During some of the worst unrest in our democracy, and in a climate already thick with suspicion and paranoia, people that had lived side-by-side in relative peace turned on each other.There is still much we have to unearth about the events that took place. The proliferation of fake news, doctored images and incor-rect information has made it difficult to separate fact from fiction. But we do know from official reports and personal accounts that people were racially profiled at illegal roadblocks, some people were pulled out of cars and beaten, and some were humiliated and degraded. Several people were killed.Much of what has hap-pened is the inevitable outcome when people take the law into their own hands. Vigilantism will not be tolerated in this coun-try. It is criminal and it is dangerous.Now that calm has been restored to the affected areas, our law enforcement agencies are investigating all acts of criminality. A team of detectives has been assigned to deal with the murders and are working closely with local communities. There have been arrests and those responsible will face the full might of the law. Much of the narrative around the events in Phoenix has been domina-ted by attempts to turn one race against another. It has been stoked by anonymous people on social media and in messaging groups making outrageous claims and calling for revenge.There is an attempt to present this as a sign of imploding race relations between African and Indian communities.Just as there were people who tried to exploit people\u2019s vulnerability and cause mayhem, there are those who want to present criminal acts in racial terms to serve their own purposes.They will not succeed. South Africa has a proud history of principled non-racialism and working class solidarity. African and Indian communities were united in the strug-gle against apartheid and, together with other com-munities, remain committed to a united and democratic society.In response to the fear and mistrust, the people of Phoenix and the neigh-bouring areas of Bhambayi, Zwelitsha and Amaoti are working to repair the damage. Aided by a peace forum established by the South African Police Service in partnership with community leaders, the communities have come together to support those affected by the unrest and to open channels of dialogue.This is not the only part of the country that is confronted with such challenges.Our efforts to build integrated communities are frustrated by the legacy of apartheid planning and persistent inequality. Our cities, towns and rural areas are still all divided by both race and class. This discourages cooperation and understanding, and hampers the work we have undertaken to build a non-racial society.Correcting these spatial distortions must be part of our work of building an inclusive economy and improving the living conditions of all South Africans. It is why we are working to build flourishing township and rural economies, and focusing on the growth of small businesses. It is why we are investing in infrastructure in these areas and working to improve the provision of services.At the same time, we need to confront racism in our society. We need to have honest conversations not only about our attitudes to one another, but also about the material conditions that divide us. For as long as the division of wealth and opportunity in South Africa is largely still determined by race and gender, we will not be able to build a truly united nation.The events in Phoenix are a painful reminder of how much work we still need to do to build inclusive communities that have suc-cessfully broken down the boundaries of the past. These events also demon-strate how determined some people are to divide us, and how we need to do every-thing we can to resist them.It is our collective respon-sibility to support these communities in eThekwini and elsewhere in their jour-ney towards reconciliation and healing.Our democracy was built by peacemakers and bridge-builders. The architects of our freedom were African, Indian, coloured and white men and women of great courage who chose the path of reconciliation over retribution, and of peace over war. As we strive to heal from this collective national trauma, let us stand as one. Let us overcome our differences in pursuit of the common good.

{"title": "Building a society free of State capture\n", "author": "vukuzenzele unnamed\n", "text": "While the commission\u2019s chairperson, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo has said it may be necessary for a few more witnesses to testify, the work of the commission is now one step closer to completion.This is a significant milestone that brings us ever closer to a reckoning with one of the most ruinous episodes in the history of our democracy.Even before Judge Zondo submits his findings and recommendations to the President, we can all agree that the commission\u2019s work has been invaluable. Over the course of three years, we have heard testimony detailing alleged acts of corruption on a massive scale. We have heard about actions that resulted in the theft of billions of rands of public money. We have heard how many public institutions and state-owned companies were deliberately weakened.This exposure of the nature, extent and depth of state capture did not take place behind closed doors, but was broadcast to the entire country. By allowing all South Africans to follow the commission\u2019s proceedings, it has helped to instil public confidence in our democracy in the way it promotes openness and transparency.The country owes a debt of gratitude to all who were involved in the work of the commission; from those who investigated, researched and compiled a huge amount of information; to the many witnesses who testified and provided evidence; to the journalists who diligently reported on the proceedings; to the lawyers who helped present evidence.We also owe a debt of gratitude to the many individuals, some of whom remain unknown, whose actions led to the establishment of the commission in the first place. These are the people who unearthed these alleged criminal acts, who resisted, who spoke out and who took up campaigns \u2013 both public and behind the scenes \u2013 to end state capture. It is thanks to them that we now speak of state capture in the past tense.State capture did not end of its own accord. It was brought to an end by the concerted actions of South Africans from all walks of life, working in various areas to restore the values of our constitutional democracy. And it is up to all of us to ensure that these practices are never allowed to happen again.Over the past three years, we have taken several important steps to tackle corruption and state capture. We have been painstakingly rebuilding bodies like the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), the South African Police Service, the South African Revenue Service and others. We have set up new structures, like the Investigating Directorate in the NPA to prosecute high-level corruption and the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) Special Tribunal to recover stolen public funds. We have improved our crime-fighting capacity through the establishment of the Fusion Centre, which brings together various law-enforcement agencies to share information and coordinate the investigation and prosecution of crime.We have changed the leadership at several strategic state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and begun the process of restoring them to financial and operational health. We are working towards a new SOE model that promotes greater transparency, accountability and sustainability.Much of this work is ongoing. There are areas where progress has been far slower than we would have hoped, and these are now receiving closer attention.The findings and recommendations of the commission will  undoubtedly strengthen these efforts. We expect that the commission will identify some of the systemic weaknesses that allowed state capture to take place. This will empower us to take further corrective measures.While we can say that the era of state capture is over, we have not defeated corruption. Fraud and corruption remain pervasive and deeply entrenched in both the public and private sectors.Although it may not be on the scale of state capture, such criminal activities cost our country greatly, weaken our institutions and deprive South Africans of many basic needs.Corruption is deeply immoral at the best of times, but takes on a greater depravity in the midst of a humanitarian crisis. One speaks here of the despicable acts of corruption last year in the procurement of goods and services needed for our fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.We acted swiftly to stop such corruption, to identify those responsible and to take action against them. This is proof of our commitment to root out corruption.We tightened up Treasury regulations, established the fusion centre and gave the SIU a wide-ranging mandate to investigate all COVID-19-related corruption allegations. In a first for the country, we also published online the details of all COVID-19 procurement contracts across all public entities.The damage done to our country by state capture is deep. Its effects will be felt for many years to come. But, working together, we have started to put things right. We have started to rebuild and restore.We can expect that the outcomes of the Zondo Commission will immeasurably strengthen these efforts. They will give us an opportunity to make a decisive and lasting break with the state capture era.Much work lies ahead, and many challenges must still be confronted. But we are on our way to building a society that is free from the evils of state capture and corruption.\n ", "edition": "2021-09-ed1", "language_code": "eng"}
{"title": "SA salutes whistleblowers \n", "author": "vukuzenzele unnamed\n", "text": "It has been an extremely complex undertaking to unravel the networks of influence that enabled corruption. Among other things, vast webs of front companies were established to move funds around and disguise payments made to politically-connected individuals.The same patterns have been seen in a number of investigations into cor-ruption being undertaken by the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) the Directorate for Priority Crime Inves-tigation, the National Prosecuting Authority's (NPA) Investigating Direc-torate and others.As these investigations progressed and the net began to close on implicated individuals, we have seen witnesses being threatened, their families intimidated, being forced into hiding, and even killed.The murder of Babita Deokaran, a senior finance official in the Gauteng health department, is a stark reminder of the high stakes involved in our collective quest to remove this cancer from our society.While we do not yet know the motive for her murder, she was a key witness in a SIU investigation into the procurement of personal protective equipment in the department.The SAPS and the private security teams who appre-hended seven suspects recently are to be com-mended for their work. The docket has been transferred to the Hawks, and the inves-tigation will yield further information on why Ms Deokaran was murdered.Regardless of the circum-stances behind this tragedy, Ms Deokaran was a hero and a patriot. As are the legions of whistleblowers who, at great risk to them-selves, help to unearth instances of misdeeds, mal-administration, cronyism and theft.Without their brave and principled interventions,  we would be unable to unmask those committing corruption. Though much focus in recent times has been on whistleblowers in the public sector, we also owe a debt of gratitude to those in the private sector whose actions receive less attention, but are equally important.Whistleblowers are important guardians of our democracy. They raise the alarm against unethical acts and practices in government and organisations.They speak out in good faith and with a reasonable expectation not only that action will be taken on their disclosures, but that they will be protected and not suffer victimisation or prejudice.In South Africa there is extensive legislative protection for whistleblo-wers, including through the Protected Disclosures Act, Labour Relations Act, Companies Act, Protection against Harassment Act, and the Constitution itself.In addition, the Depart-ment of Justice and Correctional Services, working with other law-enforcement agencies, administers the Office of Witness Protection to pro-vide support to vulnerable and intimidated witnesses in any judicial proceedings.Entering witness pro-tection is voluntary, and neither the SAPS nor the NPA can compel a witness to do so. Should a witness receive threats to their life or feel unsafe, they have to inform investigators and apply for admission to the pro-gramme. This successful programme has played a key role in securing succes-sful prosecutions since its inception, particularly with regards to organised crime.It is clear that as the fight against corruption gathers momentum, we need to urgently review our cur-rent approach not only to witness protection, but also to the broader protection of whistleblowers.While numerous systems are in place to enable whistleblowers to report anonymously, we need to tighten up existing systems and provide greater support to those who publicly come forward with information.As society, we need to identify where existing laws and policies are inadequate in protecting the livelihoods, reputations and safety of whistleblo-wers \u2013 and work together to address these.The intent of the criminals who target whistleblowers is not only to silence parti-cular individuals \u2013 it is also to send a message to other potential whistleblowers. Day by day, brave South Africans like Babita Deo-karan are standing firm that they will not be party to corruption and they are prepared to bear witness against it.As the South African people, we salute her and all the whistleblowers in the public and private sectors who are exposing corruption to the harshest of glares. They are doing so without expectation of acknowledgement or reward. Theirs is the highest form of public service.We cannot let them down. We must, and we will, ensure that their disclosures result in prosecutions and do much more to ensure that they are protected from harm.As South Africans, we want to send a strong a message that we will not be intimidated. Those behind the killing of witnesses and whistleblowers will be arrested and face the might of the law, as will all who are found guilty of the very corruption these assassins are trying to cover up.", "edition": "2021-09-ed2", "language_code": "eng"}
{"title": "Spot childhood cancer warning signs\n", "author": "Allison Cooper\n", "text": "According to Taryn See-gers, the Communications Coordinator at the Child-hood Cancer Foundation of South Africa (CHOC), it is believed that two thirds of children with cancer do not receive treatment and often those who do are already in the late stages of the disease.Since 2011, CHOC has been working with the Department of Health and traditional healers to provide health professio-nals, healthcare workers, traditional healers and com-munities with knowledge of childhood cancer. \u201cThese individuals are taught the Siluan early war-ning signs and learn how to demystify myths and stigma in communities,\u201d says Seegers.The Siluan early warning signs are:\n\u2022 Seek: Medical help for early, persistent symp-toms.\u2022 Eye: White spot in the eye, new squint, new blindness, bulging eye-ball.\u2022 Lump: Abdomen and pel-vis, head and neck, limbs, testes and glands.\u2022 Unexplained: Prolonged fever over two weeks, weight loss, pallor, fatigue, easy bruising or bleeding.\u2022 Aching: Bones, joints, back and easy fractures.\u2022 Neurological signs: Change or deteriora-tion in walk, balance or speech, regression of milestones, headache for more than a week with or without vomiting and an enlarged head.Childhood cancersChildhood cancers are dif-ferent from cancers affecting adults.

Today, in developing countries, the majority of childhood cancers can be treated very effectively, and between 50% to 60% can be cured. In high-income countries, the survival rate can be between 85% to 90%.\u201dMore children need to be diagnosed while the disease is still in its early stages and receive the correct treatment \u2013 at specialised treatment centres from appropriate specialists \u2013 if the survival rate is to be improved.  vFor more  information, contact CHOC\u2019s helpline at 0800 333 555 or go to www. choc.org.zaCHILDHOOD CANCER Awareness Month, which takes place every September, creates awareness about many childhood cancers .\n", "edition": "2021-09-ed2", "language_code": "eng"}
{"title": "BRICS key to SA's growth\n", "author": "vukuzenzele unnamed\n", "text": "Reflecting on the shifts in global alliances brought about by the end of the Cold War, he wrote that countries would have to \u201crecast their nets\u201d if they were to reap any benefit from internatio-nal affairs. Since the tectonic shift of 1994 when we made a decisive break with not just apartheid but the interna-tional relations outlook of its architects, South Africa\u2019s foreign policy continues to be characterised by this \u201crecasting the net\u201d. Our foreign policy priorities are regional political and economic integration, pursing African development, multilateral engagement and the pro-motion of democracy, peace and human rights. To this end, we have forged strategic alliances with both the countries of the Global South and mutually beneficial coope-ration with the countries of the North. Joining the BRICS group of countries in 2010 was a milestone in our quest to advance our own national development priorities by forging stronger ties with the important emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China.Put into context, BRICS countries comprise roughly 41% of the world\u2019s popula-tion and account for around 24% of global GDP and some 16% of global trade. We have reaped the bene-fits of membership of this important bloc, most nota-bly in the area of economic cooperation. Bilateral trade has grown, particularly with China and India, with commodity exports and manufactured goods imports featuring strongly. The BRICS countries continue to be important sources of foreign direct investment in key such as mining, automo-tive, transportation, clean energy, financial services and IT. A 2018 review of our BRICS membership by professional services firm Deloitte noted that BRICS partners \u201cinvested three times more capital in the country compared to the seven years prior to 2011\u201d. These investments and projects have in turn led to significant job creation. Since the formation of the New Development Bank, whose regional office is located in Johannesburg, South Africa has been a beneficiary of financing and technical support for projects in transportation, clean energy, environmental protection, water infrastruc-ture and greenhouse gas emissions reduction. Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, South Africa has received $2 billion in funding from the New Development Bank under the COVID-19 Emer-gency Loan Programme to fight the pandemic and to support our economic recovery. There has also been substantial cooperation with our BRICS partners in securing personal protective equipment and cooperation around vaccine access and distribution. We recently participated in the 13th BRICS Summit, where BRICS countries agreed to deepen coopera-tion to fight COVID-19 and mobilise the political sup-port and financial resources needed to respond to future pandemic preparedness. This includes the esta-blishment of a virtual BRICS Vaccine Research and Development Centre and a BRICS Integrated Early Warning System to forecast future outbreaks of infecti-ous diseases. Another important area of agreement was on mutual recognition of national documents of vaccination and systems of COVID-19 testing \u2013 something that will be vital to cross-border travel in the future. The concept of mutually beneficial cooperation will be particularly important in the global economic recovery, where unequal development means that some countries will bounce back quickly, while others will lag behind. In support of economic recovery, BRICS partners agreed to strengthen colla-boration in catalytic sectors such as energy, IT, science, technology and innovation, agriculture and the green economy. These are all important sectors identified in our Economic Recon-struction and Recovery Plan announced last year. Cooperation with other BRICS countries, particularly in the field of innovation research, will help to accelerate our country\u2019s industrialisation and help us meet our Fourth Industrial Revolution aspi-rations. In this regard, discus-sions were held around the creation of formal BRICS platforms to share best practice, knowledge and expertise, including the use of open source technology platforms.The BRICS partners agreed that developing countries need assistance to achieve the UN Sustainable Deve-lopment Goals, and that donor countries should honour their commitments in this regard. This is parti-cularly important within the context of climate action. Like most countries, South Africa seeks to move towards a low-carbon development path that is inclusive, sustainable and that takes into account our status as a developing country. The BRICS Energy Research Cooperation Platform will be valuable as we move to diversify our energy sources. In the 11 years since we joined BRICS, our mem-bership has substantially advanced our national interest. Being a member of BRICS has enhanced our position as an important emerging economy. It has given us access to policy and technical exper-tise of larger and established economies, as well as access to the support of the Natio-nal Development Bank.It has strengthened our activism on the global stage, particularly around reform of multilateral institutions. We have benefitted from being part of a collective voice striving to advance a world order based on mutual respect and the equal sovereignty of nati-ons. BRICS is of immense strategic importance to our country and will continue to be so for some time to come.\n ", "edition": "2021-10-ed1", "language_code": "eng"}
{"title": "COVID-19 vaccines:  Your questions answered\n", "author": "Allison Cooper\n", "text": "Q: Can the vaccine cause COVID-19 or make me test positive?A: None of the vaccines used in South Africa contain the live virus that causes COVID-19. It does not cause the virus and you will not test positive after receiving the vaccine.Q: Is it true that there\u2019s a microchip in the vaccines, that tracks people\u2019s movements?A: There is no microchip or tracking device in the vaccines. Vaccine manufacturers are required to declare the ingredients to the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) before the vaccine is approved for use. Q: I have heard that vaccines have the mark of the Beast \u2013 666. Is this true?A: Vaccines have no connection with any religious organisations and cannot be infused with spirits, demons or other abstract ingredients.Q: Should I get vaccinated if I am pregnant?A: A pregnant woman is more likely to get ill from COVID-19. Getting vaccinated can prevent a pregnant woman from being severely ill.Q: Should I stop breast feeding to get vaccinated?A: The World Health Organisation and the Department of Health do not recommend stopping breastfeeding in order to get vaccinated. Vaccines are safe for use in breastfeeding mothers.Q: Can I get a vaccine soon after being infected with COVID-19?A: Anyone who has been infected with COVID-19 must wait at least 30 days from when their symptoms stop. Q: I have COVID-19 symptoms, is it safe to get vaccinated?A: You should not get the vaccine if you have symptoms of COVID-19. You should rather be tested. Q: Can I get my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine earlier than 42 days after my first shot.A:  You are only eligible for your second jab after 42 days.Q: Do I need to be vaccinated if I have recovered from COVID-19? Can my body not fight the disease on its own, without suffering the side effects of the vaccine?A: Evidence shows that your body\u2019s response, when you are sick from COVID-19, is much weaker and shorter than the response to the vaccine. Getting the vaccine will give you a much stronger and longer-lasting immune response. The side effects of the vaccine are mild and do not last more than a day or two, while getting sick from COVID-19 can cause hospitalisation or death.Q: Can people with chronic diseases, such as high blood pressure, get the vaccine?A: People with chronic diseases are at higher risk of getting severe COVID-19. They will therefore benefit the most from getting the vaccine. Q: If I previously had an allergic reaction to medication or a vaccine should I get the COVID-19 vaccine?A: Anyone with a history of allergic reactions to other vaccines or medicines should first speak to their health practitioner. Q: How dangerous is an allergic reaction to the vaccine?A: Severe allergic reactions are rare. An allergic reaction usually happens within seconds or minutes after getting the vaccine. This is why all people must wait in the observation area for 15 minutes after their vaccine.Q: Is it safe to get the vaccine if you are allergic to eggs?A: Yes. None of the COVID-19 vaccines have any egg proteins.Q: I have heard of elderly people dying shortly after getting the vaccine. Is the vaccine safe for the elderly?A: The vaccine is safe and highly effective to prevent severe COVID-19 disease and death. Through the use of the vaccine, there has been a huge drop in COVID-19 deaths in the elderly in several countries.Q: Why do some people still get COVID-19 within two weeks of getting the vaccine?A: You are only fully vaccinated 30 days after get ting the Johnson & Johnson vaccine or two weeks after the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. If you are exposed to the virus before you are fully vaccinated, you may get the disease. Q: Does the vaccine completely prevent COVID-19 infection?A: No. Even after you are fully vaccinated you can still get COVID-19. However, the vaccine reduces risk of severe COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation and death.  vFor more informa-tion go to  https://sacoronavirus.co.za", "edition": "2021-10-ed1", "language_code": "eng"}
{"title": "Make sure you have a will!\n", "author": "vukuzenzele unnamed\n", "text": "If a person dies without making a will, the assets that they owned will be distributed in terms of the Intestate Succession Act, to the people who must rightfully inherit them.The Act sets out rules of how the estate must be distributed. It goes to close relatives first, in a specific order:\n\u2022 If you are survived by only a spouse, the spouse will inherit the entire estate.\u2022 If you don\u2019t have a spouse and are only survived by your children, they will inherit the estate in equal shares. \u2022 If you are survived by a spouse and children, the spouse will receive a child\u2019s share or R250 000, whichever is greater, and the children share the balance. For example, if the estate is worth R2 million and the deceased is survived by a spouse and three children, a child\u2019s share amounts is R500 000. The child\u2019s share is calculated by dividing the value by four. \u2022 If you have no spouse or children, but both your parents are alive, they will inherit the estate in equal shares. If one parent is dead, but left siblings, the surviving parent will inherit half of the estate and the deceased parent\u2019s descendants will receive the other half.\u2022 If both of the deceased\u2019s parents have died, but they left descendants, the estate is split into equal parts. \u2022 If the deceased does not leave a spouse, descendants, parents or parents\u2019 descendants, the nearest blood relation will inherit the entire estate.\u2022 Finally, if the deceased is not survived by any relative, the State will inherit the proceeds of the estate.\nIn addition to the above, a child born out of wedlock can inherit from both blood relations; and an adopted child is deemed as a descendant of his adoptive parent or parents.\nWhen is a will valid?A will is only valid when made by a person 16 years or older, and must meet the following requirements:\n\u2022 It must be in writing, and your signature must ap-pear on every page and at the end. \u2022 It must be signed in the presence of two or more competent witnesses.

{"title": "Ending corruption in the public service\n", "author": "vukuzenzele unnamed\n", "text": " Earlier this year, it was also found that around 16,000 employees on the government payroll were irregularly paid the COVID-19 Social Relief of Distress grant. It is common knowledge that applicants with other sources of income do not qualify for this grant. It is also self-evident that those who receive an income from the state are not eligible to apply.And yet they did. Some 17,000 people employed at national and provincial government submitted applications in a bid to top up their salaries with money meant for the poor. Given the extent of need in the country, one that our public servants know too well, this wilful intent to steal from the public purse is unforgivable.Government is now stepping up its efforts to prevent this kind of abuse and act against anyone in the public service involved in wrongdoing.Recently, government launched a new Public Administration Ethics, Integrity and Disciplinary Technical Assistance Unit. The unit will build capa-city within public bodies to institute disciplinary proceedings in cases of misconduct and cooperate with other organs of state in holding those responsible to account.The unit will refer corruption cases to government\u2019s Anti-Corruption Task Team and follow up with departments to ensure criminal cases involving public servants translate into disciplinary cases. Working with the multi-agency Fusion Centre, the unit will help identify employees in priority cases investigated by law enforcement authorities. The unit will monitor the conduct of lifestyle audits of public service employees. Where departments identify corruption and unexplained wealth, the cases will be referred to the South African Police Service. The new unit has already begun its work in earnest, helping to identify public servants involved in cases related to COVID-19 procurement, the special COVID-19 grant and Unemployment Insurance Fund fraud.The cases of government officials referred by the Special Investigating Unit for disciplinary action will be monitored by the unit to assess their progress.Another important aspect of the Unit\u2019s work will be institutionalising ethics and integrity in the ranks of the public service. A few public servants have over the years taken the view that doing business with or unduly benefiting from the State is permissible for them, their friends and their families, provided there has been no illegality. We must do everything we can to change this attitude.As we work to end corruption, there must be equal focus on inculcating ethical behaviour, because what may not necessarily be illegal can be unethical and unbecoming of a public servant.The new unit will set norms and standards on ethics, integrity and conduct. It will also build the capacity of departments to discipline officials found guilty of misconduct. Last year more than 200 employees were trained as presiding officers and initiators.Building an ethical, capable state continues to be a focus of this administration. As a number of scandals involving public servants illegally benefiting from the state have shown, the process will be difficult and will take some time. We are nonetheless committed to stay the course. A capable state is the foundation for the attainment of all our national priorities. Without improving accountability and promoting ethical conduct, none can be achieved.The vast majority of our public servants are committed, law-abiding and ethical.The task before us is to work together to root out those who are not, and correct the misconception that all those employed in government are either self-serving or corrupt.AI call on all the men and women who serve our country every day to recommit themselves to the values of selflessness and service, and to recall that their conduct must at all times be both legal and ethical.The establishment of this unit is another one of the ways that we are working on to end corruption in government and indeed in all spheres of South African life.\n  ", "edition": "2021-10-ed2", "language_code": "eng"}
{"title": "Presidential Employment Stimulus drives job creation\n", "author": "vukuzenzele unnamed\n", "text": "We established the employment stimulus last year to create as many opportunities as possible in the shortest possible time. This required new and innovative ways of working to implement programmes at an unprecedented speed and scale.The recruitment process of the many people who were unemployed made use of digital platforms to reach as many eligible participants as possible. For example, small-scale farmers were able to apply for support via USSD and receive input vouchers to their cellphones.Since the Department of Basic Education opened applications for the next cohort of school assistants recently, over 940 000 young people have applied via the zero-rated recruitment platform called SAYouth.mobi, which forms part of the national Pathway Management Network.The use of new technologies in offering employment opportunities has made recruitment much easier, quicker and more transparent.The Presidential Employment Stimulus has enabled and facilitated cooperation in the public sector. Programmes in phase one were implemented by 11 national departments. Their activities were aligned to avoid duplication and wastage and enhance learning from the experience of others.The employment stimulus has also shown the importance of social partnership. Government, business, labour and civil society have come together to bring those who are unemployed into the economy.More than half a million South Africans have already benefitted from the first phase, with several programmes still underway. Participants were given the opportunity to earn a livelihood, to learn new skills and upgrade existing ones, and to use their experience as a springboard to get another job or to self-employment.For example, a number of participants appointed by the Department of Public Works and Infrastructure in its phase one programmes were able to secure private sector employment by the end of March 2021. Many of those in the first cohort of school assistants, similarly, have found their way into employment, armed with experience, training and references.The programmes implemented through the Presidential Employment Stimulus have also benefited communities more broadly. The focus has been on job creation in sectors with direct social impact such as education, food security, public infrastructure maintenance and environmental protection.Through this Presidential Employment Stimulus young people were employed to support and assist teachers in our schools. Others were employed to build bridges in rural communities. Many Early Childhood Development Centres were helped to survive and reopen. Subsistence farmers were supported to expand production, and environ-mental assets such as rivers and wetlands were restored and maintained.As part of phase two, we are establishing a Social Employment Fund that will support work for the common good led by community organisations in areas as diverse as urban agriculture, public art, informal settlement upgrading and community safety.In the midst of the severe economic setback caused by the Coronavirus Disease pandemic, public and social employment has provided an important stimulus to job creation. This is the implementation of our commitment that the state should actively support employment while the labour market recovers.Through the Presidential Employment Stimulus we have brought young people into the labour force in far greater numbers in an unprecedented manner in a short space of time. Some 84% of the participants in phase one were young people under the age of 35, and two-thirds were women.In phase two we expect this number to be even higher, as the stimulus will provide almost R1 billion in funding for the Presidential Youth Employment Intervention. As part of the intervention, several young people will be recruited into a revitalised National Youth Service. Young people will receive training in digital skills and youth-owned enterprises will receive support to expand and hire.Unemployment in our country is a crisis. We cannot afford endless delays in addressing this problem because of bureaucratic red-tape, outdated recruitment processes, lack of capacity and planning, or programmes that are short-lived or unsustainable.The success of the Presidential Employment Stimulus has shown that when we work together, move with speed, think creatively and manage our resources well, we can make a huge impact.The Presidential Employment Stimulus has demonstrated that we can create jobs if we work together as the public sector, labour, community and government.I have no doubt that the next phase of the Presidential Employment Stimulus will bring us even closer to meeting our collective goal of decent work and opportunities for all.\n", "edition": "2021-11-ed2", "language_code": "eng"}
{"title": "Beware of sex offenders\n", "author": "Sphelele Ngubane\n", "text": "If you are an employer who runs an early childhood development centre, you are among the people required by law to check if your current and potential employees are on the National Register for Sex Offenders (NRSO).\nThe NRSO falls under the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development and employers must approach it to check if prospective employees are listed.An employer also includes a parent looking to employ a house helper, a school governing body or a hospital. The NRSO was established by an Act of Parliament in 2007. It is a record of names of those found guilty of sexual offences against children and people with intellectual disabilities.Ntombizodwa Matjila, the NRSO Registrar, says the register contains names of both male and female offenders. These are people who have committed offences against children and those with intellectual disabilities, such as:\n\u2022 Statutory rape; \n\u2022 Compelling or causing children to witness sexual offences; \u2022 Sexual acts; \u2022 Sexual exploitation; \u2022 Sexual grooming; \u2022 Exposure or display of child pornography to chil-dren or people with intel-lectual disabilities and us-ing children or people with intellectual disabilities for pornographic purposes.\u201cIf an employer finds out that the name of an employee appears on the register, the employer must move that employee to another post that will not bring him or her in contact with a child or an adult with an intellectual disability,\u201d says Matjila.If the employer is unable to move the employee to another position, they are required to terminate the employment contract.Information contained in the NRSO includes: \u001fOffenders\u2019 full names and surname, nickname and their profession or trade;  \u001fOffenders\u2019 known physical address, and any contact details, including a postal address; \u001fOffenders\u2019 identity number or passport number; \u001fThe type of sexual offence.The register is not open to the public.

{"title": "Report corruption via the anti-corruption hotline\n", "author": "Silusapho Nyanda \n", "text": "Curbing corrup tion in the public service remains a government priority and the National Anti-Corruption Hotline makes it easy for members of the public to report suspected acts of corruption.\nThe hotline was launched by the Public Service Com-mission (PSC) in 2004 and since then, more than 100 000 calls reporting alle-gations of corruption and maladministration have been received. These calls by whistle-blowers have resulted in 24 035 cases of corruption, fraud and other crimes being investigated, says Public Service Commis-sioner Michael Seloane, who oversees all the work done by the commission.\nBetween 2020 and 2021, 337 cases were reported via the hotline. Thirty-five of these involve appointment and procurement irregularities that are being investigated by the PSC. The remaining cases were referred to other government departments or law enforcement agencies for investigation. The Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) housing, tender and social grant irregularities are among the most common allegations made.\u201cDuring the lockdown we received a lot of tip-offs through email. We also have an automatic message recor-ding system for those who wish to call our hotline after hours,\u201d Seloane says.He adds that since the lowering of lockdown levels, there has been a steady increase in the reporting of social grant-related fraud, especially Social Relief of Distress grants.To strengthen efforts to curb corruption, the State has capacitated law enforce-ment agencies with skilled personnel, and established the Fusion Centre. The centre is a grouping of law enforcement agencies\nthat share information and resources in the fight against fraud and corrup-tion in the procurement of COVID-related goods and services.\n  What happens after a tip-off is made?Seloane says when a case is reported via the hotline, early resolution officers check that all the relevant information is provided. This includes the details of who did what, when the alleged act took place, and why.He says if wrongdoing is found \u2013 be it procure-ment and appointment irregularities, bribery, RDP housing related corrup-tion, social grant fraud, illegal migration, assault, theft or fraud \u2013 the PSC either recommends reme-dial action to the relevant department or refers the case to the Hawks, SAPS or Anti-Corruption Task Team for further investiga-tion.Cases the PSC refers to departments for investiga-tion, include:\n\u2022 Public servants doing extra work for money without consent of the departments\u2022 Undeclared conflicts of interests, and \u2022 Unethical behaviour. Seloane says the PSC gives government departments 60 days to investigate and close a case. He says the depart-ment then informs the PSC of its findings. \u201cIf we are happy with the steps taken by the department, we will close the case, but if we are not satisfied, we revert back to them.\u201dAnonymity  guaranteedWhen a whistle-blower does not want his/her identity revealed, the PSC hotline officer takes down only their contact details. This is important because if extra information is needed, the PSC must be able to contact them.Whistle-blowers who report cases to the PSC hotline are assured protec-tion if they want to remain anonymous, says Seloane. He explains that early resolution officers have been trained to ensure that a whistle-blower\u2019s identity remains protected.Seloane says South Africans must report corruption because it steals from the poor and stops development, which prevents the country from moving forward.\n", "edition": "2021-12-ed1", "language_code": "eng"}
{"title": "Building a foundation  for investment\n", "author": "vukuzenzele unnamed\n", "text": " We held the first Invest-ment Conference in 2018 as part of our ambitious drive to raise R1.2 trillion in new investment over five years. The conference was atten-ded by over a thousand delegates in 2018 and 2019, and in 2020 was held in a hybrid format due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Together, these confe-rences raised just over R770 billion in investment commitments across a wide range of economic sectors. The fourth South Africa Investment Conference would have been held in November 2021, but we decided to move it to March 2022 due to several other events taking place at this time. These include the local government elections, the COP26 climate conference and the Intra-African Trade Fair. Another important reason for holding it next year is that there will be far greater COVID-19 vac-cination coverage by then, making both travelling and gathering easier.Although the fourth Investment Conference has been held over by a few months, our ambitious investment drive conti-nues. Even in the midst of the challenging economic environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which was exacerbated by the vio-lence and destruction that occurred in parts of Kwa-Zulu-Natal and Gauteng in July, companies continue to make good on their commit-ments and to look for other investment opportunities in South Africa. In the last year alone, nearly R120 billion of investment commitments flowed into project con-struction or expansion. This means that around 38% of the total investment com-mitments \u2013 or R290 billion \u2013 have to date flowed into the economy. Some invest-ments have been delayed due to COVID-19, particu-larly in hard-hit sectors like property development and tourism. Pharmaceuticals is an exciting new area of growth. Aspen Pharmacare recently launched its R3.4 billion expansion, which it announced at the 2018 Investment Conference. This investment has turned Aspen\u2019s Gqeberha manu-facturing facility into one of largest global manufac-turing hubs for general anaesthetics and has also provided capacity over 100 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson COVID vaccine have been produced under contract.The World Health Orga-nization also chose South Africa to host an mRNA vaccine manufacturing hub with the Biovac Institute, which is a public-private partnership with govern-ment. South African-born Dr Patrick Soon-Shiong and his company Nant-Works recently announced an ambitious initiative to build capacity for advanced health care in Africa. In addition to the investments they will bring, these developments will also contribute to our collective ambition for the continent to manufacture 60% of its vaccine needs by 2040.Energy is another area of growth. The 25 prefer-red bidders in the fifth round of our Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme are together expected to invest around R50 billion into the eco-nomy. The increase of the licensing threshold for embedded generation to 100 megawatts is likely to result in substantial private investment in electricity generation projects. South Africa has recently secured an initial commit-ment of around R131 billion to fund a just transition to a low carbon economy by investing in renewable energy, green hydrogen and electric vehicles. This commitment by the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany and the European Union is in line with the Paris Agreement, which obliges wealthier countries to support decar-bonisation in the developing world. These energy investments will help us overcome the debilitating load shedding that the country is currently experiencing, as new elec-tricity generation capacity comes online. Several new investments in datacentres and undersea cables will not only bring in new investment, but will provide the infrastructure needed for the growth of technology and telecommu-nications industries. An important part of our investment drive are the far-reaching structural reforms we are undertaking in areas such as energy, telecommu-nications, water and ports and rail. These reforms will improve efficiency and competitiveness, bringing down the cost of doing busi-ness in South Africa, and encouraging greater private investment in our economic infrastructure. We now have 13 special economic zones across the country, providing investors with targeted investment incentives, preferential tax rates and export sup-port. These provide an attractive manufacturing base for companies seeking to supply both local and international markets. Their value has increased further with the establishment of the African Continental Free Trade Area, which officially commenced trading at the beginning of the year. While the rate of invest-ment has slowed due to the effects of the pandemic, and several projects have been delayed, the investment drive is beginning to gather pace once again. As we make progress with the implementation of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan \u2013 with its focus on infrastructure, industrial development, employment and structural reform \u2013 the environment for investment will improve further.\n", "edition": "2021-12-ed1", "language_code": "eng"}

To date, ASIDI has built 266 schools, provided 886 schools with sanitation, 1 030 with water and 372 with electricity.\nThe learners of Nkululeko Ralo Primary School now have proper classrooms and access to a resource centre, science laboratory, multi-pur pose and a nutrition centre. \nA shared vision\nPrincipal Koleka Gilman is passionate about improving education in Mthatha.\nHer dream to start a school for her community began in 1988, and the following year, she began sharing her vision with the community.\n\u201cOur community was highly populated with a lot of children of school-going age who had nowhere to go for education. My vision was welcomed by community member Nkululeko Ralo, who offered his home garage to be used as a school,\u201d says Gilman.\nShe adds that Ralo went on to organise a container from Telkom and it was used as an additional classroom.\nRalo also arranged with two members in his community to offer their garages as additional classrooms. Ralo sadly passed away in 2004.\nIn 1994, the school moved to the Eli Spilkin Hall, which was built by local businessman Eli Spilkin.\n\u201cIn the same year, we received mobile toilets from the provincial Department of Education.\nI then looked [for] and applied for a site where we would eventually build our school. We received five hectares of land in 1998,\u201d says Gilman.\nThree temporary class-rooms were donated to the school by a non-profit organisation called Kats and Spaks, and the community built five mud classrooms.\nThroughout the years, Gilman continued to advocate for the school to be improved and eventually, five classrooms were received from the Eastern Cape Premier\u2019s Office.\nIn 2014, things took a positive turn when the Department of Basic Education, through ASIDI, issued a tender to build Nkululeko Ralo Primary School.\n\u201cConstruction started in 2018 and the school was completed in 2021, thanks to ASIDI,\u201d says Gilman. \nInspiring teaching and learning\nBasic Education Deputy Minister Reginah Mhaule says the department wants to ensure that the physical infrastructure of every school inspires learners to attend school and learn, and educators to teach.\n\u201cThe building of this school is government\u2019s way of restoring dignity to rural and under-privileged school-going children and their teachers,\u201d she adds. A member of the school governing body, Nomuntu Dlengane, says the new school will motivate tea chers and learners to reach their full potential.\n\u201cOur learners\u2019 attitudes and self-confidence have already improved due to the new infrastructure.\nThis will also help us maintain social distancing in our classrooms so that we can eliminate the spread of the Coronavirus Disease,\u201d says Dlengane.\nThe school has 489 learners, 14 teachers, and two administration clerks.\nIt caters for grades R to 7 and is a non-fee paying school.", "edition": "2022-01-ed1", "language_code": "eng"}

This is 7% more than in the previous reporting period.\nOf the nearly 73 000 assault cases reported during this period, more than 13 000 were domestic violence-related. The rate of child murders has climbed by nearly a third compared to the previous reporting period.\nWe have said before that the violence perpetrated by men against women is the second pandemic that our country must confront, and like the COVID-19 pandemic it can be overcome if we all work together.\nAs government, we have a duty and responsibility to devote the necessary resources to combat crimes of gender-based violence (GBV).\nSince the launch of the National Strategic Plan to Combat Gender-based Violence and Femicide (NSP) in 2020, there have been a several interventions to respond to GBV.\nThis includes far-reaching legislative reform, support to survivors through the provision of evidence kits at police stations and psycho-social services, the establishment of a Gender-Based Violence and Femicide Fund and supporting the network of Thuthuzela and Khuseleka Care Centres.\nThe SAPS has indicated we are making progress in reducing the significant backlogs in DNA analysis, which is crucial to securing justice for survivors of sex crimes.\nThe SAPS also operates 134 GBV desks at police stations around the coun try and is in the process of establishing more.\nGBV is a problem of male violence. It is predominantly men who are rapists. It is mainly men who are perpetrators of domestic violence.\nBecause it is men who are the main perpetrators, it should be men taking the lead in speaking out and reporting GBV, in raising awareness, in peer edu cation and in prevention efforts.  It should be men in positions of authority in our educational system, whether as school principals, educators or lecturers, who should be making schools and places of higher learning safe spaces for female learners and students, and never, ever abusing their position of authority to demand sexual favours.\nMen should also be playing a more formative and present role in their families, particularly in raising their sons to exhibit healthy, positive masculinity that is respectful of women and child ren.\nCommunities and community organisations must work with government to implement interventions that redefine masculinity so that we raise men with empathy, tolerance and respect.\nJust as ending GBV cannot be the state\u2019s responsibility alone, the onus cannot be on women and children to end the shocking levels of violence and abuse being visited upon them.\nSouth African men need to play a greater role in preventing GBV. They need to understand what constitutes GBV, especially sexual violence.\nThe latest crime statistics show nearly 4 000 people were raped in their homes or that of the perpetrator, and in 400 reported rape cases the victim and perpetrator had a relationship.\nThis suggests that some men do not understand that sexual activity without explicit consent is a crime.\nMen must respect their wives and girlfriends and understand that being in an intimate partner relationship is never a justification for domestic violence.\nIf each man gathers two men and the three pledge to never rape a woman, never lay a hand on a woman and hold each other accountable to this pledge, we can start to seriously tackle GBV in  our country.\nIt is not enough to intervene only once perpetrators have entered the criminal justice system.\nWe have to prevent GBV before it happens.\nI call on all South African men, young and old, city dwellers and rural dwellers, modernists and traditionalists, married and unmarried, to be part of the prevention efforts that are sorely needed in homes and in our communities.\nBy refusing to condone violence against women and children, by not being party to it yourself and by reporting such acts, you are setting an example to your fellow men, especially to young men and boys.\nYou will be sending a clear sign that neither kinship, friendship or loyalty can be an excuse for not standing up for the rights of women and children.", "edition": "2022-01-ed1", "language_code": "eng"}

We are extremely gra teful to the firefighters who battled the blaze and finally extinguished it.\nThe investigations into the cause of the fire are now underway. We need to ensure that these investigations are thorough and concluded without delay.\nThe country needs to know what happened.\nArrangements are being made to ensure that the work of Parliament can continue even if the buildings cannot be used.\nIt is vital that Parliament continues to consider and pass laws that will transform society and continues to provide oversight and  ensure accountability as government works to implement the mandate it received from the people.\nApart from the close proximity of St George\u2019s Cathedral and Parliament, what connects these two events is that each reminds us of what brings us together as South Africans: our democracy.\nWe mourn Desmond Tutu because he was the spiritual father of our democracy.\nWe despair at the devas tation of our Parliamentary buildings because they are the seat of our democracy. They are the place where our new democratic Constitution was adopted just over 25 years ago, and where hundreds of trans formative laws have been passed.\nWe may not always recognise it, but the fire at Parliament demonstrated how strongly South Africans feel about their democracy. It is a reminder  also of how important it is that we work to strengthen and defend that democracy.\nWhile the Parliamentary buildings have been damaged beyond use, the institution of Parliament continues its work in the service of the people.\nThis is an important reminder that our democratic institutions are not defined by the buildings that house them, but by the work they do and by the confidence that the people have in them.\nThis is true of all the institutions of our democracy.\nJust as the fire in Parliament was finally being extinguished, Acting Chief Justice Raymond Zondo submitted the first part of the report of the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture.\nThis part of the report details how several public institutions were infiltrated, looted and severely damaged. These include state-owned enterprises like South African Airways, the Government Communication and Information System and the South African Revenue Service.\nThis part of the report paints a deeply disturbing picture of how key instituti ons of our democracy were compromised and undermined with criminal intent.\nNot only were significant amounts of money stolen, but these institutions were not able to properly fulfil the functions for which  they were established.\nThe findings and recommendations of the Zondo Commission will help the country to rebuild these institutions and to hold those responsible to account.

But despite penalties to remove perpetrators from society, women and children continue to suffer and die.\nI recently signed into law three pieces of legislation that honour our promises to strengthen the criminal justice system, promote accountability across the state and put support for survivors at the centre of all our efforts.\nThe new Criminal and Related Matters Amendment Act protects the vulnerable from secondary victimisation by allowing courts to appoint intermediaries through which a minor, a disabled person or an elderly person can be examined in proceedings.\nIt also allows for the extended use of evidence by means of an audio-visual link. This helps to shield a witness against harm, prevent unreasonable delays and save costs in proceedings.\nThe new law also significantly tightens up our bail regime.\nA prosecutor who does not oppose bail in designated cases must have their reasons placed on record.\nThe court must consider any threats of violence made against the complainant and the complainant\u2019s view of their own safety.\nUnless the court is satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist that warrant release on bail, bail must be denied.\nThe new Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act outlaws sexual exploitation and grooming of persons with mental disabilities, and provides that sexual offences against persons who are mentally disabled must be recorded in the National Register of Sex Offenders (NRSO).\nWe have responded to calls to tighten up the management of the NRSO.\nThose who have been convicted of sex crimes against children or mentally disabled persons, have previous convictions in this respect, and have been sentenced to terms longer than 18, months can only apply to have their names removed from the register after 20 years.\nThe Act further regulates the reporting duty of people who are aware that sexual offences have been committed against vulnerable persons.\nThe new Domestic Violence Amendment Act takes account of some of the complexities in violent domestic relationships.\nWe have tightened up the process of obtaining protection orders, and broadened the circumstances under which they can be applied for.\nWe have addressed the issue of women and children being victimised despite having, or being in process of applying for, a protection order.\nIf a court believes a complainant is in imminent danger it can issue a protection order immediately without needing to give a respondent notice of the proceedings.\nSignificantly, if the court releases someone charged with domestic violence on bail who does not have a protection order granted against them, the court must issue one after holding an enquiry.\nWhen the court issues a protection order it must at the same time authorise the issuing of an arrest warrant, suspended, that must be provided to the South African Police Service (SAPS).\nIf a SAPS member sus-pects a complainant is in danger due to breach of the order, they must arrest the respondent immediately.\nThe Act now expressly protects the elderly from all forms of domestic violence, and also permits complainants to apply for protection orders online, saving them time and travel costs.\nTo protect complainants against further abuse, the court may an issue a Safety Monitoring Notice that will require a member of SAPS to be in constant contact with the complainant without the knowledge of the abuser.\nSurvivors of GBV often complain of ill-treatment or disregard for their concerns when they lay complaints at police stations. SAPS members who fail to comply with their obligations under the new law will be guilty of misconduct.\nAll adult persons who have knowledge or suspicion that domestic violence is being perpetrated against a child, a person with a mental disability or an elderly person are obliged to report such acts to a social worker or to the police. Failure to do so is a criminal offence.\nThis puts into law the principle that violence against women and children is everyone\u2019s responsibility.\nThe passage of these new laws is a step in this direction. But it is not the solution. We must prevent violence and abuse from happening in the first place.\nWorking together as a society, we must use our voice, our agency and our reserves of courage to forever end the violence perpetrated by men against women and children.

The key task of government is to create the conditions that will enable the private sector \u2013 both big and small \u2013 to emerge, to grow, to access new markets, to create new products, and to hire more employees,\u201d he said.Around 80% of employed people work in the private sector.\nThe President said government will introduce a new loan guarantee scheme to help small businesses recover.\nThe Presidential Employment Stimulus Programme, which has already supported over 850 000 employment opportunities, will be stepped up. Most of the beneficiaries were young people; over 60% were women.\nThe employment stimulus will enable the Department of Home Affairs to recruit  10 000 unemployed youth for the digitisation of paper records, and the Social Employment Fund will create another 50 000 work opportunities. The Department of Higher Education and Training will place 10 000 unemployed technical and vocational education and training graduates in workplaces from April 2022.\nThe SAYouth.mobi platform, which helps young work seekers to access opportunities and support, now has over 2.3 million youth registered.\nOf these, over 600 000 have been placed into employment opportunities.\n\u201cA revitalised National Youth Service will recruit its first cohort of 50 000 young people during the next year [2023], creating opportunities for young people to contribute to their communities, develop their skills and grow their employability.\u201d \nSRD Grant continuesThe COVID-19 Social Relief of Distress (SRD) Grant, which has helped over  10 million unemployed people, has been extended for another year \u2013 to the end of March 2023.\nIn addition, government and its partners will look at ways to continue to support people in financial distress in a manner that is affordable to the country over the long term.\nAccess to land\nGovernment is moving ahead with land reform and anticipates the approval of the Expropriation Bill this year. The establishment of the Agriculture and Land Reform Development Agency will also be finalised this year.\n\u201cThe Department of Public Works and Infrastructure will finalise the transfer of 14 000 hectares of state land to the Housing Development Agency,\u201d the President said.\nHe added that there is enough arable land to support millions of thriving small-scale farmers in poultry, livestock, fruit and vegetables.\nAlready, over 100 000 farmers have received input vouchers to expand their production and the programme will be expanded to reach more farmers. \nCorruption and crime\nFrom instituting the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, to investigating COVID-19-related procurement contracts, President Ramaphosa is leaving no stone unturned when it comes to ending corruption.\n\u201cNone of our efforts to revive our economy will succeed if we do not tackle the scourge of corruption once and for all,\u201d the President said.\nBy no later than 30 June 2022, he will present a plan of action in response to the Commission\u2019s recommendations.\nHe explained that various government agencies were working together to identify wrongdoers, punish them, and to get looted State money refunded.\nSafety and security will be strengthened through the recruitment of 12 000 police personnel and the reestablishment of community policing forums.\nFighting GBVF \nGovernment will also continue to intensify the fight against Gender-Based Violence and Femicide (GBVF) this year, through the implementation of the National Strategic Plan on GBVF.\nThree new laws are already working to strengthen the criminal justice system and support survivors. \u201cThe implementation of this legislation will go a long way to ensuring that cases are successfully prosecuted, that survivors are protected and that there are more effective deterrents in place.\u201d  One of the new laws that President Ramaphosa was referring to is the Criminal and Related Matters Amendment Act which protects the vulnerable from secondary victimisation.\nThis Act allows the courts to appoint intermediaries through which a minor, a disabled person or an elderly person can be examined in proceedings.\nThe President was also referring to the new Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act which outlaws sexual exploitation and grooming of persons with mental disabilities.

{"title": "Public and private sector key to economic growth\n", "author": "Vukuzenzele Unnamed\n", "text": "Some people have suggested that we must make a choice between, on the one hand, a developmental state that plays a vital role in economic and social transformation, and, on the other, a vibrant, expanding private sector that drives growth and employment.\nThe reality is that we need both. We need a capable developmental state and a dynamic and agile private sector. We need them to work together and complement each other.\nThis idea is not new. Thirty years ago, in 1992, the African National Congress adopted a document titled \u201cReady to Govern\u201d. The document set out policy guidelines for a democratic South Africa and has, over nearly three decades, influenced the policy direction of successive democratic administrations.\nThe \u201cReady to Govern\u201d document envisaged a democratic state with ultimate responsibility for coordinating, planning and guiding the development of the economy towards a sustainable growth pattern\u2019 in cooperation with the trade union movement, business and other organs of society.\nIt spoke of the need for economic policy that democratises the economy and creates productive employment opportunities at a living wage for all South Africans.\nThe document further envisages a dynamic private sector, employing the skills and acumen of all South Africans \u2026 and of business activities which contribute significantly to job creation, being actively encouraged.\nIn the recent State of the Nation Address, I outlined how government, business and labour should work together, each using their unique capabilities, to create jobs.\nOne of the most important drivers of growth and employment are stateowned enterprises (SOEs).\nThey generate electricity, manage the ports, build the roads and supply the water that the economy needs to function.\nSince the advent of democracy, these SOEs have significantly expanded access to basic services for the poor. That is why a critical part of our programme is to strengthen state-owned enterprises, restoring them to financial health, improving their operational performance and enabling them to play a more prominent and beneficial role in the economy.\nTrue to the role envisaged in \"Ready to Govern\", the state directs both growth and transformation through levers like competition policy, broad-based black economic empowerment provisions and employment equity laws, and by linking the award of various licences to universal service and empowerment obligations.\nGovernment is also directly involved in employment creation beyond those people employed in the public service. The Expanded Public Works Programme, which has been in existence since 2003, has provided work opportunities to millions of people.\nMore recently, in response to the devastating economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, this government has overseen the most significant expansion of public employment in our country\u2019s history.\nThe Presidential Employment Stimulus has supported more than 850 000 opportunities in just 16 months. In addition to expanding public employment, we are providing support to unemployed young people to prepare them for work, make them more employable and connect them to opportunities.\nThere are many other ways in which government is contributing directly to job creation, including through large-scale investments in infrastructure, the establishment of special economic zones and through support to labour-intensive growth industries.\nA special focus this year is on small, medium and micro businesses, on cooperatives and the informal sector.\nThrough the redesign of the loan guarantee scheme that we introduced in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are making \u2018bounce back\u2019 finance more accessible for small businesses.\nWe are expanding the employment tax incentive and looking at various other regulatory changes to make it easier for small businesses to employ more people.\nAs I indicated in the State of the Nation Address, these are among the measures we are taking as government to create the conditions that will enable the private sector \u2013 both big and small \u2013 to emerge, to grow, to access new markets, to create new products, and to hire more employees.\nThe private sector employs some three quarters of South Africa\u2019s workers and accounts for over two-thirds of investment and research and development expenditure.\nAlongside a capable and developmental state, our country therefore needs a thriving private sector that is investing in productive capacity.\nAs private sector employment expands, more livelihoods are supported and sustained. Goods and services are delivered at a greater scale and the democratic state is able to collect more revenue for social development.\nThe \u201cReady to Govern\u201d document says that the role of the state should be adjusted to the needs of the national economy in a flexible way, whether it is increasing the public sector in strategic areas or reducing it in others.\nWe will not achieve such an economy without both a strong and capable developmental state and an inclusive, fast-growing private sector. We should not be asked to choose  one or the other. We need both.", "edition": "2022-03-ed1", "language_code": "eng"}

{"title": "All you need to know about epilepsy\n", "author": "Vukuzenzele Unnamed\n", "text": "According to Dr Nhlakanipho Gumede, the Clinical Manager of Medical Services at Harry Gwala Regional Hospital in Pietermaritzburg, epilepsy is not a psychological disorder, disease or illness, and it is not contagious.\nHe explains that epilepsy is a neurological disorder marked by sudden recurrent episodes of sensory disturbance, loss of consciousness or convulsions, associated with abnormal electrical activity in the brain.\n\u201cThe brain comprises of billions of nerve cells (neurons) communicating through electrical and chemical signals. When there is a sudden excessive electrical discharge that disrupts the normal activity of the nerve cells, a seizure may result.\n\u201cA single seizure does not necessarily mean you have epilepsy. A diagnosis by a medical practitioner needs to confirm this,\u201d he says.\nAccording to Epilepsy South Africa, 80% of people with epilepsy will be able to control their seizures with medication.\nCauses and seizures\nThe cause of epilepsy in six out of 10 people is not known. In the other 40%, it can be caused by a head injury, injury during the birthing process, alcohol and drug abuse, aging or a metabolic or biochemical disturbance or imbalance.\nDr Gumede says the signs and symptoms of epilepsy vary, and can present in various ways, including generalised absence seizures (petit mal), when a person looks blank and stares; generalised tonicclonic seizures (grand mal), which commonly start with body stiffening, before the person falls down and has jerking movements; and complex partial seizures, which affect a part of the brain.\nA petit mal seizure only lasts a few seconds, and the person may be unaware that they had one. During a grand mal seizure, the person may have a blue colour around their mouth, which fades when normal breathing resumes. Grand mal seizures usually last a few minutes.\n\u201cProtect the person from injury by moving objects away and cushioning their head. Don\u2019t restrict their movement or put any thing in their mouth. Help breathing by laying the person on their side when the seizure ends. Stay with the person until they have fully recovered.\u201d\nDuring a complex partial seizure, the person may appear confused, distracted or drunk.

{"title": "Special Tribunal is showing that crime does not pay\n", "author": "Vukuzenzele Unnamed\n", "text": "But the arm of the law is long. Those who have stolen from the state may believe they have gotten away with it. But their deeds will eventually catch up with them, whoever they are, and whatever position they may hold.\nThey will learn that crime does not pay.\nIn this regard, one of our most effective weapons in the fight against corruption and state capture is the Special Tribunal of the Special Investigating Unit (SIU), which I established in 2019.\nIt adjudicates on matters that the SIU institutes for civil litigation after it has concluded its investigations. The Special Tribunal was set up to speed up litigation. This approach has made it possible for public funds and state assets lost to corrupt acts to be recovered faster, avoiding delays in the high courts, where the SIU has to wait its turn together with other litigants.\nThe SIU can request preservation orders and the freezing of assets to prevent further losses to the State. This is important when considering that per petrators who are under suspicion often go to great lengths to move around, hide or dispose of proceeds of corruption.\nThere can be no doubt the Special Tribunal has been a game changer. Since its establishment, the Tribunal has recovered around R8.6 billion from unlawful contracts.\nFor any fight against corruption to be deemed effective, it is not sufficient that perpetrators are pro secuted. The proceeds of their crimes must be recovered. This money belongs to citizens and should be used to meet their needs.\nThe Special Tribunal recently ordered two construction companies to return the profits they earned from R40 million in contracts to erect the Beit Bridge border fence. This followed an investigation by the SIU that uncovered a number of irregularities, including a pre-payment to the companies by the Department of Public Works and Infrastructure.\nOver the past few weeks alone, the Tribunal has reviewed and set aside more than R100 million worth of irregular and unlawful contracts arising from COVID-related pro curement.\nThe Special Tribunal has also been successful in getting back money from senior executives in state-owned enterprises who conducted irregular business activities. For example, last year a former Transnet executive was ordered to pay R26 million he received as a shareholder of a firm of consulting engineers contracted to Transnet while he was a full-time employee.\nThe SIU has in a number of cases approached the Tribunal to delay the payment of pension benefits, pending the outcome of its investigations, to public servants implicated in financial irregularities or fruitless and wasteful expenditure.\nThe cases before the Special Tribunal show that much work still needs to be done to strengthen governance and management across all arms of the state. They point to serious lapses on the part of accounting officers and failures to adhere to laws and regulations governing procurement I have said before that winning the war on cor ruption will be difficult, and that it will take time to unravel the vast webs of patronage that had become entrenched.\nI have also maintained that we must fight private sector corruption with equal vigour, because for every public sector employee willing to be bribed, there is a business person willing to pay a bribe.\nThese corrupt relationships have eroded the capacity of the state to deliver on its mandate.\nThey have set back the state\u2019s efforts to provide decent healthcare, to deliver clean water, and to ensure a consistent supply of power to communities and businesses.\nBut, as the Special Tribunal has demonstrated, we are steadily turning the tide. Not only are perpetrators being arrested and taken to court; they are also having to forfeit the proceeds of their crimes.\nThere is still a long way to go, and there is a huge amount of stolen public funds that still need to be recovered. But the SIU and the Special Tribunal have made a good start, and I am confident of many more successes in the months and years ahead.", "edition": "2022-04-ed1", "language_code": "eng"}

The commission delivered its final report by the end of the same year.\nFour years later, SARS has implemented nearly all of the 16 recommendations and 27 sub-recommendations to restore stability to the organisation.\nSARS has driven a focused turnaround strategy to position itself at the forefront of efficiency and service excellence. It has a concerted programme to promote tax morality and compliance.\nCurrent high commodity prices, resulting in increased corporate income tax revenues, have contributed to the latest revenue collection windfall. What has also played a role are the steps SARS has taken to improve its information technology and other infrastructure, modernise customs, recruit skilled staff, and combat tax avoidance and criminal activity.\nOne of the recommendations of the Nugent Commission was that SARS re-establish capacity to monitor and investigate illicit trades.\nThe Illicit Economy Unit that was reconstituted in 2018 has notched up a number of successes in combating illicit economy trades, including through a focus on customs noncompliance.\nTax collection from JSE listed companies, multinationals and high net worth individuals is now more effectively managed through its Large Business Unit, which was relaunched in 2020.\nAs a result of SARS\u2019 turnaround there has been improved compliance in personal income tax, corporate income tax and Pay as You Earn.\nSARS is taking the wind out of the sails of tax dodgers, beneficiaries of the proceeds of crime, and those involved in corrupt activities. It is well-established that \u2018the taxman\u2019 is one of the most efficient tools to combat corruption.\nIn cases where an individual\u2019s lifestyle does not match what they declare, SARS has been conducting lifestyle audits. In the last year, SARS has completed lifestyle audits that resulted in the collection of a further R474 million.\nAs we forge ahead with efforts to strengthen the capacity of the state and rebuild institutions that were systematically weakened by state capture, we have much to learn from what SARS has achieved in a relatively short space of time.\nWhen state institutions are well-run and efficient, when they demonstrate credibility and fairness in their operations, this contributes to increasing levels of trust in government. Business and investor confidence also improve, encouraging greater investment and economic growth.\nThe leadership and the staff SARS are to be congratulated on its performance. Thanks must go to the loyal South African taxpayer. Without their cooperation, the latest revenues would not have been possible. That SARS has expanded the tax base with 1.8 million new registrations over the past year is another sterling achievement.\nWe can only rebuild South Africa if we continue to meet this shared obligation, and if we intensify the work currently underway to ensure that these taxes are used wisely and efficiently.", "edition": "2022-04-ed2", "language_code": "eng"}

{"title": "Fight crime, not migrants\n", "author": "Vukuzenzele Unnamed\n", "text": "In adopting this Constitution, we affirmed our commitment to a society based on democratic values, social justice and human rights. We were also making a complete break with our past. This was a past of race-based social engineering that manifested itself through influx control, job reservation, group areas and the dreaded dompas.\nWhen our forebears drafted the Freedom Charter in 1955, whose principles have been incorporated in our Constitution, and declared that South Africa belongs to all who live in it, they were seeking a society free from ethnic chauvinism, tribalism, racism and sexism. It is therefore deeply disturbing how the recent incidents of anti-foreigner sentiment in parts of the country echo our apartheid past. We have seen people being stopped on the street by private citizens and being forced to produce identification to verify their immigration status. We have seen some political leaders making unscientific statements about immigrants to exploit people\u2019s grievances for political gain. We have seen marches being led on people\u2019s homes and their dwellings raided for evidence of criminal activity. We have seen people being attacked, hurt and even killed because of how they looked or because they have a particular accent.\nThis was how the apartheid oppressors operated.\nThey said some people could only live in certain areas, operate certain businesses or take certain jobs. Under apartheid, black people were deemed suspects by default and stopped by police when found in so-called white areas. Black people were forced to produce a dompas and if they could not do so, they were jailed.\nWe cannot allow such injustices to happen again.\nThe events in the Gauteng township of Diepsloot recently were a tragedy.\nIn the course of a single weekend, seven people were killed, sparking protests. This loss of life is deplorable, as is the killing of a fellow African from Zimbabwe allegedly at the hands of vigilantes. Crime is a serious problem in this country.\nIt affects all communities and people are justifiably tired of living in fear of criminals. Contrary to what is claimed by some antiimmigration groupings and individuals, the perpetrators of crime are both black and white, male and female, foreigner and citizen. Crime, not migrants, is the common enemy we must work together to defeat. We cannot defeat crime through incitement, violence, intimidation and vigilantism aimed at foreign nationals, and specifically nationals from other African countries. We acknowledge many communities are frustrated by the apparent inability of the police to deal with criminals. Among the measures we are taking to capacitate the police is the recruitment of an additional 12 000 additional police officers.\nWe are also re-establishing community policing forums across the country. These forums bring communities and police representatives together to improve local safety and hold police accountable.\nEven as we intensify our fight against crime, there is no justification for people taking the law into their own hands. At the same time, we recognise that illegal migration poses a risk to South Africa\u2019s security, stability and economic progress.\nIllegal migration affects service delivery and places additional burdens on essential services such as health care and education. Like any sovereign nation, we have the right to implement policies and measures that guarantee the integrity of our borders, protect the rights of South Africans and provide that all who reside in our borders have a legal right to be here. Controlling migration is the responsibility of government.\nNo private citizen may assume the role of immigration or law enforcement authorities by demanding that foreign nationals produce identification.\nUnder Section 41 of the Immigration Act, only a police member or immigration officer can ask someone to identify themselves as a citizen, permanent resident or foreign national.\nIf these officers believe, on reasonable grounds, that the person is in the country unlawfully, they may be detained while an investigation into their status is conducted. When doing so, law enforcement authorities must respect that person\u2019s rights and dignity.\nEnforcement of migration legislation is a priority for government. We are working to ensure that syndicates perpetrating immigration fraud in collusion with corrupt officials are brought to book.\nLike all other businesses, foreign-owned businesses must obey the relevant laws, including health and safety regulations, have all the required permits and licences, and pay the necessary taxes.\nWe are a democracy founded on the rule of law.\nActs of lawlessness directed at foreign nationals, whether they are documented or undocumented, cannot be tolerated. Today, our anger may be directed at nationals from Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Nigeria or Pakistan.\nTomorrow, our anger may be directed at each other. Let us focus on defeating crime, no matter who commits it.\n", "edition": "2022-05-ed1", "language_code": "eng"}

While the responsible government departments and entities drive these reforms, Operation Vulindlela monitors and identifies challenges and blockages. Where needed, it facilitates technical support to departments.\nThe recent quarterly report outlines the progress made by Operation Vulindlela and the departments responsible for these reforms.\nAcross government, our focus is on reforms that are fundamental and transformative; that reshape the way our economy works.\nThis includes the auction of high-demand spectrum for mobile telecommunications, which was delayed for more than 10 years and finally completed in March.\nThe release of new spectrum will improve connectivity and bring down broadband costs.\nThe establishment of the National Ports Authority as a separate subsidiary of Transnet last year had been delayed for more than 15 years. This was the necessary first step towards enabling private sector participation and increasing the efficiency of our port terminals.\nWe have also reinstated the Blue Drop, Green Drop and No Drop system for the first time since 2014 to ensure better monitoring of water and wastewater treatment quality. We have published an updated Critical Skills List, also for the first time since 2014.\nThese are just some examples where, by focusing effort and attention on a limited number of priority reforms, this administration has been able to drive progress.\nThrough Operation Vulindlela, we have also been able to take a more focused and holistic approach to reforms, ensuring better coordination where multiple departments and entities are involved.\nThe best example of this is in the energy sector, where a number of important, interconnected reforms are underway to change the way that we generate and consume electricity.\nMilestones include the raising of the licensing threshold for new generation projects to 100MW, allowing these projects to connect to the grid and sell power to customers. We have revived the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme through the opening of new bid windows.\nChanges to the regulations on new generation capacity have allowed municipalities to procure power independently for the first time.\nAnd legislative reforms will ultimately give birth to a new competitive electricity market, supported by the publication of the Electricity Regulation Amendment Bill and the work underway to amend the Electricity Pricing Policy.\nThe process of unbundling Eskom is on track, with the entity meeting its December 2021 deadline for the establishment of a National Transmission Company. By December this year we hope to complete the unbundling of Eskom\u2019s generation and distribution divisions.\nThe quarterly report highlights a number of other important achievements, as well as areas where intensive work is underway.\nIn the water sector, Ope-ration Vulindlela has been providing technical support to the Department of Water and Sanitation to implement a turnaround plan for the granting of water use licences, with a target to process 80% of all applications within 90 days.\nWork is also underway to establish a National Water Resources Infrastructure Agency that will ensure better management of our national water resources.\nIn the transport sector, inefficiencies in port and rail have severely affected our ability to export goods.\nWork is underway to establish partnerships with private sector operators to invest in port infrastructure and improve the management of container terminals at the ports of Durban and Ngqura.\nThe White Paper on National Rail Policy, which was approved by Cabinet in March, outlines plans to revitalise rail infrastructure and enables third party access to the freight rail network. Transnet Freight Rail is already in the process of making slots available for private rail operators on the network.\nA fully operational e-Visa system has been launched in 14 countries, including some of our largest tourist markets. A comprehensive review of the work visa system is also underway to enable us to attract the skills that our economy needs.\nThese reforms have been made possible due to better collaboration across government behind a shared reform agenda.\nWe call on business and investors to take advantage of the changes that are underway and turn their pledges and commitments into tangible, job creating investments.", "edition": "2022-05-ed2", "language_code": "eng"}

In KwaZulu-Natal, as in the Eastern Cape and North West, all stakeholders have been hard at work to recover from these tragic events.\nThe National Disaster Management Centre has been coordinating all spheres of government in their efforts to provide humanitarian relief to the many households that have been affected. It has been pleasing to see the non-governmental organisation community, business and relief organisations joining in working with government to provide much-needed relief assistance.\nAll these stakeholders have provided food, clothes, blankets, dig nity packs and school uniforms to vulnerable families to meet their basic needs. Sheltering services are currently being provided to over 7,000 people in the four most affected districts in KwaZuluNatal. Work has started to build temporary residen-ces for affected families on state-owned land parcels have been identified in KwaZulu-Natal for possible resettlement.\nThe Departments of Home Affairs, Health and Social Development have been assisting affected communities to access important services. For example, mobile units are helping those who lost critical documents in the floods to get new smart IDs and to re-issue birth certificates. Mobile health services, including COVID-19 vaccinations, are being provided to people in areas where the physical facilities are not yet fully operational.\nMechanisms are in place to pay out the social grants of affected indivi duals.\nMobile classrooms are being procured so that learning and teaching should not be interrupted for longer than necessary in flood-affected schools.\nWork is underway to repair damaged waste water treatment works, pump-stations and reticulation. Damaged roads are being repaired. Eighteen new bridges are planned as part of the Welisizwe Rural Bridges programme.\nThere has also been considerable progress in fixing key infrastructure supporting the Port of Durban. Given the importance of the port to the national and continental economy, port traffic has been restored, terminal operations are back at full capacity and work to repair damaged rail infrastructure is underway.\nAdditional measures are being put in place to provide financial support to both big and small businesses in distress.\nThis is needed as a matter of urgency to ensure that businesses can stay afloat and that jobs can be sustained.\nAt different times in our democracy\u2019s history, we have been confronted with events and circumstances that have severely tested the resolve of our people and the effectiveness of our institutions.\nWe have seen extraor dinary solidarity and support to affected communities in KwaZuluNatal, Eastern Cape and North West. Municipal and provincial governments have been working closely with national departments and agencies to enable people to rebuild their lives and to get local economic activity back on track.\nThey have been working with all stakeholders in all of these areas to ensure that we effectively coordinate recovery efforts and that we plan and rebuild in a manner that is more resilient to extreme events of this nature in the future.\nThe perseverance of affected communities, their determination to succeed and their ability to rally together in times of crisis has been an inspiration. We salute all those who have been part of the effort to help the people of the affected provinces.\nAs government, we are mobilising all available resources and undertaking every effort to ensure that, as we rebuild, no-one is left behind.\n", "edition": "2022-06-ed1", "language_code": "eng"}

I started working there about a month after my final exams and I\u2019ve been enjoying every moment of it,\u201d she says.\nThe Health and Welfare Sector Education and Training Authority (HWSETA) is committed to addressing the extreme skills shortage in the veterinary sector and ensuring transformation.\nIt recently launched a Veterinary Science Career Guidance Campaign, in partnership with the Department of Higher Education and Training, and will be visiting rural schools to encourage learners to consider veterinary services as a career path.\nIt also announced 60 bursaries to address the critical shortage of veterinarians and paraveterinarians in South Africa\u2019s rural areas.\n\u201cThe bursaries are specifically aimed at learners in rural areas as they can take their knowledge back to their homesteads,\u201d says Dr Nomfundo Mnisi, the Chairperson of the HWSETA.\nThe Deputy Minister of Higher Education, Science and Innovation, Buti Manamela, welcomed the bursaries.

Wasaa has acquired all the terminal\u2019s moveable assets and a 20 percent share in berth-toterminal pipelines.\nWith the 2020 report by the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Commission showing that most economic sectors are falling short of their black women ownership targets, this acquisition by a black and female-owned company of a liquid fuel terminal is a historic development.\nIt contributes to our national effort to redress inequality and ensure there is meaningful participation by the country\u2019s majority in our economy.\nRecently, I announced the appointment of the new Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Advisory Council, which comprises government, business, labour and other stakeholders. It was established to champion the cause of economic transformation.\nThe council has its origins in a 2001 report produced by the BEE Commission.\nThis report emanated from an extensive study into the structure of the South African economy, and what was needed to transform the economy, grow black entrepreneurship, ensure greater black management and ownership of busines ses, and bring black women into the mainstream of the economy.\nNext year, it will be two decades since the BroadBased Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) Act \u2013 which established the council \u2013 was passed.\nOur commitment to entrench and deepen economic empowerment is unwavering. That is why black economic empowerment is an integral part of our economic reconstruction and recovery in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThis is one of the reassurances I articulated to the Black Business Council earlier last month, where we discussed the state of B-BBEE in the country, the progress that has been made and what we need to do as a collective to build on our gains.\nWhile there has been significant progress over the last two decades, there are some areas where there has been regression. We have gone backwards when it comes to increasing black management control, upscaling skills development, entrenching enterprise deve lopment and broadening procurement to give opportunities to black women and the youth.\nThe apartheid government deliberately built a distorted economy designed to benefit white people. The majority of South Africans were marginalised from the mainstream economy, with black entrepreneurs confined to small retail industries in the townships.\nAt the end of apartheid, black ownership of JSElisted companies was less than 1 percent. This figure has not improved much in the past 28 years.\nAt the same time, there have been important private sector initiatives and deliberate measures by the state to facilitate greater and more meaningful participation of black people in the economy.\nBetween 2017 and 2020, nearly 500 empowerment transactions were submitted for registration to the B-BBEE Commission. In key sectors such as construction, property, information and communications technology, tourism and transport, black ownership has exceeded targets.\nEconomic transformation and economic growth are intertwined. There cannot be one without the other.\nBy integrating transformation into the process of industrialisation, we are advancing a more inclusive growth model that shares, rather than concentrates, wealth.\nThe Department of Trade, Industry and Competition (DTIC) is pursuing this goal through various programmes. They include a support programme for township businesses, export-related training by the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) to black, women and youth-owned businesses, and increased infrastructure budget to SMMEs in the Tshwane Special Economic Zone.\nThrough sectoral masterplans we are driving localisation that benefits black owned businesses. For example, 10 black contract growers have been established with an investment of R336 million as part of the poultry masterplan.\nGovernment has also launched a black exporters network that will connect black-owned companies in food, engineering products, auto components, beauty products and other sectors of the economy.\nAs part of our drive to create a new generation of black industrialists, last year government approved R2.5 billion in new support to about 180 black industrialists in the form of loans from the IDC and National Empowerment Fund (NEF) and grants from the DTIC incentive scheme. Over the next three years a further R21 billion has been com-mitted by the IDC, NEF and other institutions to support black industrialists. An additional R25 billion has been committed to support black, women, youth and worker-owned companies.\nIt is clear that much more work needs to be done to address the many challenges that black businesses face. This includes the difficulty of accessing start-up and expansion capital and the ability of SMMEs to find markets for their products.\nBlack women-owned businesses, in particular, encounter difficulties in taking on large-scale empowerment transactions.\nBreaking the cycle of underdevelopment through black economic empowerment is not just a moral imperative; it also makes business sense.\nThe continued exclusion of the black majority from the economy\u2019s mainstream constrains economic growth, which ultimately impacts all business.\nExpanding the country\u2019s entrepreneurial base is fundamental to growth.\nWe have a shared responsibility to drive the effort to entrench B-BBEE because it is about eradicating inequality. Unequal economies breed unequal societies, and unequal societies don\u2019t grow and flourish.\nIt is not only wrong, but also unsustainable, for businesses to keep their management and ownership structures mostly white or male.\nIt is, after all, the South African public that are the primary consumers of their goods and services.\nThis should be reflected in diversity of hiring and management practices, in ownership and in procurement.\nBroad-based black economic empowerment will only be achieved through partnership and a shared commitment to transformation.\nThe appointment of the new B-BBEE Council will help us to expand the frontiers of broad-based black economic empowerment. I call on business, labour and industry to work with the council as it undertakes this vital work.", "edition": "2022-06-ed2", "language_code": "eng"}

Illegal abortion is not an answer,\u201d says Dr Dhlomo.\nThe Department of Health has 346 public health facilities that provide safe termination of pregnancy services, he adds.\nThese are located in the Eastern Cape (46), Free State (16), Gauteng (25), KwaZulu-Natal (56), Limpopo (54), Mpumalanga (27), Northern Cape (six), North West (26) and Western Cape (90).\nIllegal abortion complications\nThe Acting Director for Maternal Child and Women\u2019s Health at the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Health, Phalanndwa Muthuphei, says women can face many complications when having an abortion at an illegal abortion clinic.\n\u201cThe immediate complications include severe bleeding, tearing of the cervix, severe damage to the genitals and abdo-men, internal infection of the abdomen and blood poisoning.\n\u201cIn the long-term, women could face a slightly increased risk of infertility, an ectopic pregnancy, a miscarriage or premature delivery or even death,\u201d says Muthuphei.\n\u201cWomen could also suffer emotional effects from an unsafe, illegal abortion, which include posttraumatic stress disorder, depression and problems with interpersonal relationships.\n\u201cUnsafe abortions can also lead to negative socio-economic impacts on women, children, families and communities,\u201d she adds. \nLegal abortion options\nMuthuphei says women who want to end their pregnancy have safe and free options to do so at public clinics and hospitals.\n\u201cA choice of methods should be available, all of which must be performed by a trained and experienced doctor or professional nurse,\u201d she adds.\nThe options, either medical or surgical abortion, depend on how far along the woman\u2019s pregnancy is.\nMedical abortion, which involves taking two sets of pills to end the pregnancy, can be done up until nine weeks of pregnancy.\n\u201cThe patient would then abort the foetus at home and not at a clinic or hospital,\u201d says Muthuphei.\nSurgical abortions are performed by a registered nurse (up to 12 weeks) or a doctor (from 12 to 20 weeks).\nAccording to the Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act No 92 Of 1996 (the Act), an abortion can also be performed from 13 to 20 weeks if a doctor, after consultation with a pregnant woman, believes that:\n\u2022 The continued pregnancy poses an injury risk to the woman\u2019s physical or mental health.\n\u2022 There\u2019s a substantial risk that the foetus would suffer from a severe physical or mental abnormality.\n\u2022 The pregnancy resulted from rape or incest.\n\u2022 The continued pregnancy would significantly affect the woman\u2019s social or economic circumstances.\nAn abortion can also take place after the 20th week if a doctor, after consultation with a registered midwife, believes that the continued pregnancy would endanger the woman\u2019s life, result in a severe malformation of the foetus or pose a risk of injury to the foetus.\nAccording to the Act, all women, even if they are a minor under the age of 18, have the right to terminate a pregnancy.\nThey do not need permission from their parents or guardian. According to the Western Cape Department of Health, if you are a minor, you will be advised to talk to an adult you can trust and to bring someone with you to your appointment.

{"title": "Rising cost of living calls for a united response\n", "author": "\n", "text": "It has become increasingly more expensive to buy food and other essentials, to pay for basic services and to use public or private transportation. While these rising costs affect everyone, low-income households are feeling them the most.\nThe latest Consumer Price Index for April 2022 published by Stats SA shows there has been little respite for hard-pressed South Africans. Food inflation was recorded at 6.2 per cent. The most basic foodstuffs cost more than a year ago, with staples like cooking oil recording the highest increases.\nThe price of fuel, which affects the price of almost everything else, has risen by a third in the twelve months to March 2022.\nSouth Africa is not alone in this regard.\nA recently published poll for the World Economic Forum shows that nearly a quarter of people globally, including those in developed economies, are struggling financially due to rising prices.\nThese increases, particularly the price of fuel, are the consequence of events over which we have little control. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has had a significant impact on the price of fuel and food.\nBoth countries are major exporters to international markets of fertilisers, grains and oilseeds that are needed for a range of items such as cooking oil.\nAnother factor is lower agricultural output due to extreme weather events caused by climate change, such as flooding and droughts.\nWhile many of these events are beyond our control, government is doing what it can to shield the South African from current and future price increases.\nOne of our greatest advantages as a country is a strong, independent Reserve Bank that has managed to keep inflation within a narrow target range, well below what many other countries are experiencing.\nWe recently announced that the fuel levy will be suspended for another two months to August, which will bring some relief to households. The suspension of the levy has provided essential relief to South Africans since it began in April. Since the suspension of the levy comes at a significant cost to public finances, which affects other programmes of government, it will be difficult to continue this indefinitely.\nThere are, however, other things we can do.\nImproving our nation\u2019s food security is vital to withstanding this and future shocks. We have a strong agricultural sector that continues to grow and create jobs.\nTo further increase agricultural production and strengthen our food sovereignty, we are investing heavily in improving local capacity, supporting commercial and small-scale farmers alike and helping more people to grow their own food.\nThrough the Presidential Employment Stimulus, input vouchers have been given to over 65,000 smallholder farmers, and work is underway to reach 250,000 such farmers. Government is also providing subsistence farmers with fertilisers and equipment to produce food, and helping groups or individuals to start their own food gardens.\nIn provinces like North West, small-scale farmers are supported with agricultural \u2018starter-packs\u2019 of seedlings and poultry, in partnership with local agricultural colleges.\nThrough the Pro-Active Land Acquisition Strategy and the release of state-owned land for agriculture, we are supporting more small-scale farmers to expand their businesses and make them commercially successful.\nWe are also focusing on establishing more publicprivate partnerships to support the expansion of black commercial farming through initiatives like the Partners in Agri Land Solutions and the Agricultural Development Agency.\nTo enhance biosecurity and safeguard animal health against diseases like foot-and-mouth, we are strengthening our animal movement control measures and vaccine production capabilities.\nIn addition to boosting local food production, our extensive social grants system and zero-rating of basic goods helps to protect the poor from rising costs. Through free basic services like water and electricity for indigent households, we can ensure that no family goes without basic services.\nTo get through this difficult period, all of society should get involved.\nFor our part, government will continue to monitor the situation closely and will do everything within its power to protect South Africans from unsustainable increases in the cost of living.\nCorporate South Africa should ensure that consumers do not pay more for food than they have to. We welcome the indications from food manufacturers and retailers that they are putting measures in place to help consumers get more for their money.\nIn March this year the Competition Commission released for public comment the terms of reference for a market enquiry into the fresh produce market. It noted that the cost of fresh produce has been increasing at above-inflation levels, and that this has had a disproportionate effect on the poor. The inquiry will examine if there are any distortions in the value chain that make food more expensive.\nWe will use our competition policy to protect consumers against unjustifiable price increases and anticompetitive practices by businesses, as we did during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe ongoing process of structural reform of our economy will support these efforts. Reforms in the energy, transport and telecommunications sectors aim to reduce the cost of electricity, logistics and data in the long term through greater competition and efficiency. We should be paying less, not more, for these services in the future.\nThough oil prices and extreme weather are events over which we have little control, there is still much we can do, as government, business, labour and communities to help the people of South Africa through this difficult time.\n", "edition": "2022-07-ed1", "language_code": "eng"}

Flowing from the investigations, the Buffalo City Metro is looking into whether the tavern violated any municipal regulations.\nOur thoughts and prayers are with the families who are struggling to come to terms with this unspeakable horror.\nWe commend the Eastern Cape provincial government for assisting the affected families, as well as AVBOB that has pledged to assist the families with the burials.\nEven as the relevant authorities deconstruct what happened to ensure there is justice for the victims, there is a conversation we do need to have as a country. It is the problem of under-age drinking.\nThe footage and images posted online of the socalled \u2018pens down\u2019 party at the venue that night show revelling youngsters clutching bottles of alcohol. Many of those in the images look barely out of their teens.\nA number of young people from Scenery Park have told the media of having seen a post circulated on social media, offering free rounds of alcohol to all who attended the event that night.\nThe increased social acceptability of young people drinking alcohol has become a serious problem in a country where the majority of the drinking population are already classified by the World Health Organization as binge drinkers.\nAlcohol use amongst adolescents is associated with impaired function, absenteeism from learning, alcohol-related injuries, suicidal thoughts and attempts, and risky behaviour.\nWe must come together to combat this vice that is robbing our young people of the best years of their lives, and making them susceptible to alcohol addiction.\nAs families it means having open and frank conversations about alcohol and setting boundaries. Children under the age of 18 consuming alcohol is against the law.\nAs adults we should refrain from practices such as sending minors to buy alcohol for us or capitulating to requests to buy these young people alcohol.\nIt is not the first time we have been confronted with tragic events such as what happened in Scenery Park last week.\nA common denominator between Enyobeni tavern, the Throb nightclub disaster in Durban in 2000, and the Osi\u2019s tavern tragedy in Khayelitsha in 2015, is that these establishments were selling liquor to minors.\nThe proliferation of establishments openly flouting the law points to failings on the part of authorities to enforce regulations.\nUnder the National Liquor Act, owners of establishments with liquor licenses may not sell alcohol to anyone under the age of 18. They must also take reasonable steps to ensure anyone they are selling alcohol to is of age.\nWe call on communities to work with authorities to ensure that taverns, shebeens, entertainment venues and outlets breaking the law face the consequences.\nWe call upon our police to step up the enforcement of laws that prohibit the sale of alcohol close to schools and enhance monitoring of outlets to ensure alcohol is not being sold to minors.\nAnother reality is that alcohol is a form of escapism for young people in communities were opportunities for safe and age-appropriate recreation are few.\nThe Scenery Park community has pointed to the lack of sports, learning and other developmental facilities for young people, leading them to resort to \u2018tavern hopping\u2019.\nIn the wake of the tragedy, the community has pointed out that there are no viable sports grounds, community libraries or youth centres in Scenery Park.\nAs government at national, provincial and local level we need to respond to the pleas of this community and those of other communities by developing more recreational spaces, facilities, programmes, and projects for our young people in disadvantaged areas in the province.\nOther social partners such as the business community should also assist with sponsorship.\nAs communities we must work with our Community Policing Forums, with our civics organisations and with our school governing bodies and play a more active role in the lives of our children and in ensuring their safety and well-being.\nAs they say in our African indigenous classics \u201cit takes a community to raise a child\u201d.\nLet us work together to protect our precious future generation from the ravages of alcohol and drug abuse and their effects.\nLet us work together to ensure that those who put profit before the lives of our children are not allowed to operate.\nLet us also set a positive example in our own relationship with alcohol.\nLet us be keepers of not just our own children, but our neighbours\u2019 children as well.\n\n", "edition": "2022-07-ed2", "language_code": "eng"}

{"title": "We can and will do more to end load shedding\n", "author": "vukuzenzele unnamed\n", "text": "Stage 6 load shedding was triggered by the loss of more than 18 000 megawatts (MW) of generation capacity due to unit breakdowns and an unprotected strike by Eskom workers.After more than a decade of electricity shortages, South Africans are right to feel frustrated and angry. At times like this, it can feel like there is no end in sight.Yet, while load shedding appears to worsen, the reality is that we have already taken several important actions to address the shortfall in electricity supply.Our immediate priority is to stabilise the electricity system. As the system recovers and generation capacity is restored, Eskom will be able to reduce load shedding to lower stages.The agreement reached between Eskom and labour unions will enable critical repairs and return additional units to operation. The transmission line from Cahora Bassa in Mozambique has been restored, adding 600 MW to the grid, and Medupi Unit 6 returned to service recently adding another 720 MW. Additional units are expected to come back online, further easing the current shortfall. At the same time, law enforcement agencies are working hard to tackle sabotage, theft and fraud at Eskom to address the threat that these criminal actions pose to the electricity system.\nIn the end, the bottom line is that we need to add more capacity to the grid. This will create space for Eskom to undertake critical maintenance and increase the reliability of its fleet. It will also create a buffer so that even if several units experience breakdowns at once, other sources can be used.One of the first steps I took in 2018 was to revive the renewable energy procurement programme. In addition to the procurement of new generation capacity through this programme, the increase of the licensing threshold for new generation projects to 100 MW means that private investors do not require a license to build generation facilities up to this size. This simple reform has unlocked a massive potential pipeline of investment. Eskom has made land available next to existing power stations for private investment in renewable energy projects. Design modifications have been completed to improve the performance of Medupi units 1, 2 and 3 and are underway in units 5 and 6.While these actions are significant and will bear fruit over the coming months, they are clearly not enough to address the crisis that we face.What the past few weeks have demonstrated is that we need to do more and do so with the utmost urgency.There is no reason why a country like ours \u2013 with the skills, capabilities and resources we have at our disposal \u2013 should have to endure a shortage of electricity.Over the past few weeks, we have been working with the relevant Ministers and senior officials on a range of additional measures to accelerate all efforts to increase our electricity supply. The message is clear: this is no time for business as usual. We need to act boldly to make load shedding a thing of the past.While the measures we have already taken will secure the supply of reliable and affordable electricity into the future, we have been looking at what additional measures we can take now to bring that goal closer.We will soon be completing the detailed work and consultations needed to finalise these further measures. We will then, soon, be able to announce a comprehensive set of actions to achieve much faster progress in tackling load shedding. There are no easy solutions to our electricity crisis. But we are committed and determined to explore every avenue and use every opportunity to ensure that we generate enough electricity to meet the country\u2019s needs.\n", "edition": "2022-08-ed1", "language_code": "eng"}

{"title": "Support the police to make South Africa safe  \n", "author": "vukuzenzele unnamed\n", "text": "There is growing public frustration and anger at the levels of crime in our country.\n  The recent robbery and gang rape of eight young women in Krugersdorp caused nationwide outrage and led to calls for decisive action against armed illegal mining gangs operating in the area.\n  The South African Police Service is to be commended for its decisive actions over the past three weeks in response to the gang rape and criminality in the area. However, communities have rightly pointed out that it should not take a high profile crime for action to finally be taken against criminality.\n  The reality is that there are serious challenges facing policing in South Africa. But we are working hard to overcome them.\n  Like all government departments, the South African Police Service is feeling the effects of the country\u2019s fiscal crisis, several years of understaffing and state capture. Police members also work in a dangerous environment where they often have to face violence, injury or death.\n  Crime in South Africa cannot be eradicated without a strong, capable, professional police force. The capacity of the SAPS was one of the issues flagged in the report of the Expert Panel into the July 2021 Unrest, which we are taking steps to address.\n  Having restored much-needed stability to the leadership of the SAPS, our focus now is on closing capacity gaps that led to our law enforcement authorities being found unprepared to deal with the events of last July.\n Understaffing and lack of adequate training has had a particularly dire impact on community and Public Order Policing.\n  Government has allocated funding for the recruitment of 12,000 new police trainees, and the first cohort is undergoing basic training. The SAPS Public Order Policing Units will receive an additional 4,000 members this financial year, and arrangements are being made for appropriate training for members.\n  Drawing on the lessons of last July\u2019s unrest, we are working to improve cooperation between law enforcement agencies and the private security industry in the fight against crime.\n  We need close coordina tion with all stakeholders, including business, so that resources and crime intelligence are shared to both improve public safety and deal with crimes that disrupt economic activity.\n  An example is the colla boration between Transnet Freight Rail and the SAPS to combat infrastructure theft and line sabotage. These crimes seriously affect the economy as companies cannot move their products to the ports for export. Another example of cooperation is between mine security, private security and the SAPS to fight precious metals theft.\n  As a result of these joint efforts, we are seeing progress in areas like Mpumalanga and Limpopo that have been flashpoints of instability as stolen metals were moved to illicit markets abroad.\n  Through its national inter vention units, the SAPS has also been making progress in combating organised crime, including drug syndicates, gangs and illegal mining.\n  The SAPS is establishing a task team to tackle illegal mining, alongside other task teams dealing with construction site extortion, copper and cable theft, and theft and vandalism of economic infrastructure.\n  Besides the successes of effective policing in tackling economic crimes, the hard work of the SAPS in dealing with broader crime often goes unacknowledged. In the last financial year, for example, SAPS Crime Investigations secured 206 life sentences against 209 accused, of which 154 were for murder and rape. The SAPS Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Units secured 356 life sentences against 266 accused. Suspect tracing operations resulted in over 13,000 arrests.\n  Given the high levels of crime in our society, there is clearly much more that must be done. But these figures do show that many criminals are being arrested and successfully prosecuted. They are not being allowed to get away with murder.\n  The Directorate for Prio rity Crime Investigation, known as the Hawks, achieved all of its targets for the last financial year, resulting in arrests and convictions, asset seizures, restraint and confiscation orders and forfeiture orders to the value of millions of rands. The arrests and convictions secured by the Hawks included for illegal mining, damage to fuel pipelines, cash in transit heists and for police murders.\n  The Hawks have started work with the NPA Investigating Directorate on cases emanating from the state capture commission.\n  The SAPS has been sup porting the fight against gender-based violence, establishing more victim-friendly rooms at police stations and procuring nearly half a million evidence collection kits to be distributed to stations.\n  Policing cannot be suc cessful without the cooperation of communities. For this reason, we are focusing on expanding the network of Community Policing Forums to improve both policing and community relations.\n  We commend the com munities that are taking responsibility for keeping their areas safe through street patrols, crime awareness campaigns and other activities.\n  Using the report of the Expert Panel as a basis for organisational reform, we are re-organising and reprioritising resources, improving capacity and strengthening law enforcement capacity across the board.\n  Being a policeman or policewoman must be one of the most difficult, pressured and dangerous jobs in our country, and often a thankless task. While public frustration with crime is understandable, it is unfortunate that this should give rise to hostility towards our police, who continue to serve and protect.\n  As government works to provide the police with the necessary resources, training and budgets to perform their work, I call on all South Africans to join the effort to keep our streets and communities free of crime.\n  Let us acknowledge the hard work of our police and give them our full support in making South Africa a safer place.\n ", "edition": "2022-09-ed1", "language_code": "eng"}

It is known as SIP2.The project will widen the \nN3 with more lanes in each direction. It also includes changing some of the major interchanges to improve traffic flow.The affected section of the N3 has over the years experienced traffic congestion, particularly during peak hours because the majority of cargo trucks from the Durban harbour use the highway to Gauteng and other inland provinces. Some of the cargo truck drivers have caused accidents by not taking care on sharp curves.\u201cApart from resolving chronic traffic by creating greater mobility through the construction of additional traffic lanes, the upgrading of the N3 will result in increased safety. Dangerous curves will be ironed out. Unsafe intersections will be redesigned,\u201d Maketane says.Sanral awarded three contracts in the last quarter of 2021, and construction work began between January and April. The sections currently being upgraded are the 19 kilometre (km) stretch from Cato Ridge to Dardanelles, commonly known as Umlaas Road; the 26.6 km section from the Dardanelles Interchange to Lynnfield Park; and the 30 km stretch from Lynnfield Park to the Ashburton Interchange. Matekane explains that SIP2 will strengthen the logistics and transport corridor between South Africa\u2019s main industrial hubs, improve access to Durban\u2019s export and import facilities and raise efficiency along the corridor.  He adds that the project is part of the National Development Plan 2030 and National Transport Master Plan 2050 and supports government\u2019s Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan.To this end, government intends to develop a transport system that is consistent with the real needs of the people living in South Africa and caters for people with less money to spend on travel.Maketane says the upgrades will take between eight and 10 years to complete and road closures will be kept to the minimum. He adds that motorists will be kept informed of traffic delays and the KwaZulu-Natal traffic authorities will help maintain traffic control.Sanral appeals to motorists to heed all warning signs, reduce their speed when approaching a construction site and to have consideration for other road users .

The TVEP has also created employment for 44 people who serve in various departments such as finance, human resources and evaluation.Despite receiving continuous funding of R90 000 quarterly from the Limpopo Department of Social Development, the TVEP was affected by COVID-19 as many funders pulled out, thus negatively affecting the organisation\u2019s operational processes.However, the Gender-Based Violence and Femicide (GBVF) Response Fund, which was launched by President Cyril Ramaphosa, together with the International Women\u2019s Forum of South Africa and social partners have assisted the programme.

The fund was launched by President Cyril Ramaphosa in February 2021, to support the implementation of the National Strategic Plan on GBVF. According to the fund\u2019s website, it plays a critical role in making change happen, based on research, awareness and practical support to organisations actively engaged in the fight against GBVF.\n  One of the organisations supported by the fund is the KwaZulu-Natal based Gugu Dlamini Foundation, which received R250 000 from the GBVF in 2022.\n  Executive Director of the Gugu Dlamini Foundation, Mandisa Mabaso, established the foundation in 2010 after her mother \u2013 the late Gugu Dlamini \u2013 was stoned to death in 1998 in Durban for disclosing her HIV-positive status.\n \u201cThe foundation aims to strengthen local governance to improve the GBVF response, which is essential to achieving HIV epidemic control in South Africa,\u201d says Mabaso.\n  \u201cIt also aims to reduce HIV/AIDS infections, increase access to care and improve health outcomes for females and males infected and affected by HIV/AIDS,\u201d she adds.\n  The funding that the foundation receives assists 522 255 women and girls and 900 men and boys from families affected by GBV and domestic violence; abused persons living with disabilities; and the LGBTQIA+ community, says Mabaso.\n  According to UNAIDS, in areas of high HIV burden, women who are victims of GBV face up to a 50% higher chance of acquiring HIV . Some of the reasons for this are rape and the refusal by men to use condoms.\n What is PrEP? One of the ways to prevent HIV infection is by taking Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), which is a medicine taken daily by HIV-negative people who are at high risk of being exposed to HIV , through sexual contact or injection drug use.\n  In August, Health Minister, Dr Joe Phaahla said that South Africa has the highest oral PrEP initiation in sub-Sahara. He said that 70%, or 2 419, of South Africa\u2019s public primary healthcare facilities have integrated oral PrEP into their routine package of services.\n  \u201cA person on PrEP does not have to take it for the rest of their lives, they can choose to take it every time they are at risk of being infected with HIV . However, for PrEP to be effective, it must be taken every day [during this time],\u201d confirms Mabaso.\n  It should also be used with other protective methods, such as female and male condoms, because PrEP does not protect a person against other sexually transmitted infections and it is not a contraceptive.\n  Mabaso says that in cases where a couple wants to have a baby, PrEP can assist to prevent HIV infection of the\nHIV-negative partner and the unborn baby.\n  Meanwhile, earlier this year, the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority approved the use of a vaginal ring as a PrEP . The ring contains an antiretroviral drug called dapivirine and must be changed every month. In addition, a new PrEP \u2013 an injection that lasts for two months \u2013 is awaiting approval. Once approved, people will no longer have to remember to take a pill each day.\nSafe sex  The foundation also aims to reduce HIV infections by promoting the use of condoms and safe sex.\n\u201cWe urge children and youth to delay engaging in sexual intercourse until they are ready to make more informed and healthier choices,\u201d says Mabaso.\n  \u201cWe also promote safer sex by emphasising condom use and only having one partner at a time. The abuse of drugs \u2013 especially those that are injected \u2013 is strongly discouraged as it increases the risk of being infected with HIV ,\u201d she adds.\n  The foundation also empo wers people living with, at risk of and affected by HIV/GBV to know their rights and to access justice and legal services to prevent and challenge the violations of human rights.\n\n\n", "edition": "2022-12-ed1", "language_code": "eng"}
{"title": "What HIV positive breastfeeding moms should know\n", "author": "vukuzenzele unnamed\n", "text": "  According to the depart ment, if you are an HIV positive breastfeeding mother, it is important to discuss feeding choices with your HIV counsellor.\n  If you choose to breast feed, be sure to breastfeed exclusively for the first six months.\n  Research has shown that the baby has very little chance of getting HIV from breastmilk if the mother exclusively breastfeeds.\n  During the months that you are pregnant, and breastfeeding, be sure to use a condom during sexual intercourse to prevent any new infection. If you have any problems such a painful nipples or breasts, be sure to go the clinic early for help.\n  The department strongly recommends exclusive breastfeeding because it helps the baby develop a stronger immune system, and a stronger bond between mother and baby. Breastfeeding also reduces the mother\u2019s risks of developing breast cancer. Breastfeeding myths and facts There are several myths asso-ciated with breastfeeding, the department debunked these myths by answering the following frequently asked questions by mothers who are HIV positive and those who are not HIV positive.Question: My neighbour said that I should get some medicine to clean my baby's stomach. Is this important?Answer: Colostrum, which is the first form of breast-milk that is released by the mammary glands after giving birth, cleans the meconium from the stomach. You will not need any medicines for further cleaning as breastmilk is clean, and actually lines the stomach, protecting it from bacteriaQuestion: In the first few days, if I do not have enough milk, can I give water or other milk as well?Answer: The colostrum is all the baby needs. You just need to feed the baby often so that the milk will come in you make lots of milk that way. Ask the midwife to give you your baby within the first half hour after birth, so you can put the baby to the breast. The baby will learn quickly how to suckle and this will help you to make more milk.Question: I am giving breastmilk, but the baby is not satisfied. Do I need to give formula as well?Answer: No, you can make more milk by feeding the baby more often. Allow the baby time to drink until satis-fied on one breast to make sure the baby gets hindmilk which is the is the milk your baby gets at the end of a feed. The more the baby suckles, the more milk is made.Question: My baby wants to feed so often maybe I don't have enough milk?Answer: Maybe the baby is growing quickly, and so needs more milk. By feeding often, you can make enough milk for their needs. The milk will not run out. Allow extra time for the baby to suckle don't pull the baby off the breast. If a baby has more than six wet nappies every day, is being fed often (at least 8-12 times every day), and the baby is gaining at least 500g every month, then you are making enough milk.Question: If my baby cries often, what do I do?Answer: Comfort your baby by putting them to the breast more often. Babies need to be close to their mothers. Mothers and babies sharing the same room will encourage this. If your baby is hungry, thirsty or upset, suckling at the breast will satisfy them. It is unlikely that you will overfeed your baby when giving breastmilk only.Question: Is it good to give other drinks?Answer: No, adding other drinks means that the baby is more likely to get diseases like diarrhoea and pneu-monia. Also, if the baby has other drinks, they won't suckle as often and you won't make enough milk.Question: Doesn't the baby need water when it is hot?Answer: No, the first milk (foremilk) has lots of water and quenches the baby's thirst. Just make sure you feed your baby often in hot weather.Question: When should I add other foods?Answer: After six months, continue breastfeeding as before, but add other foods as well. The baby is only ready to start learning about eating after 6 months.\n", "edition": "2022-12-ed1", "language_code": "eng"}
