The effect of an increase in VAT to 15 percent from 14 percent is going to be buffered by South Africa's high level of social services. That's according to Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba who says the increase, which takes effect on 1 April, will also see South Africans enjoy greater relief from below inflation increases in personal income tax rebates and brackets, and steps government is taking towards free higher education. From 1 April 2018 old age disability grants will increase from R1 600 to R1 690 and to R1 700 in October. Child support grants will increase from R380 to R400 in April, and to R410 in October. This is a 6.6 percent annual increase. Since October 2017’s Medium-Term Budget an additional R2.6 billion has been added to social grants to enable these increases. “As highlighted by the President in the State of the Nation Address, government will ensure that social grants will continue to be paid without disruption,” said Minister Gigaba. In its budget review, National Treasury said expenditure on social protection provides social security and a safety net for low-income South Africans. It also improves social welfare service delivery to vulnerable individuals through policy and legislative reform, growing the number of social workers, improving access to Early Childhood Development and facilitating food and nutrition initiatives. “Spending on social protection is set to rise from R193.4 billion in 2018/19 to R223.9 billion by 2020/21, growing by an average of 7.9 percent. The number of social grant beneficiaries is expected to reach 18.1 million by the end of 2020/21.” An estimated 12.8 million people will receive the child support grant and 3.7 million people will receive the old-age grant.
