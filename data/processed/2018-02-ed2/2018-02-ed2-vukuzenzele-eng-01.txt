She said the first-of-its kind PET-CT imaging system in Africa serves as testimony to the department’s commitment to improving patient care. “The facility brings advanced oncology care to patients, with a new leading- edge oncology diagnostics facility that harnesses multiple technologies to provide high-quality data quickly,” she said. The oncology facility is fitted with new equipment including an advanced Philips Ingenuity TF PET/ CT which is a nuclear imaging technique. It evaluates the structure and function of cells and body tissue providing oncologists with a patient-specific method of treatment. “The system has already helped guide decision making for early diagnosis and assessment of treatment efficacy for over 105 patients since its installation.
