Madiba shapes another life

Struggle icon former President Nelson Mandela said, “Edu cation is the great engine of personal development. It is through education that the daughter of a peasant can become a doctor, the son of a mine worker can become head of the mine and the child of a farm worker can become the president of a great nation”.
Dr Buntu Godongwana (35), one of eight students to receive an inaugural MRF scholarship in 2005, is proof of this.
“Our progression from hum ble beginnings in Guguletu, Cape Town, to sharing ideas on international platforms, with world leaders in our discipline, is living testimony of Madiba’s words,” he said.
Dr Godongwana, now a lecturer at the Department of Chemical Engineering at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT), said the scholarship is a special award.
“Being selected in the inaugural cohort will always be a highlight of my aca-demic career. It’s more than a monetary award, it served as affirmation of our values and recognition of our leadership potential.
“It came with the responsibility of setting the tone and benchmark for future scholars; living the principles of leadership, as embodied by patron Mandela; and giving substance and form to his vision of building exceptional leadership capacity in Africa. I was truly humbled and honoured to be a part of this great vision.”Born in Guguletu in 1983, Dr Godong-wana matriculated from Fezeka Senior Secondary School as the best academic achiever in 2000. He completed his under graduate studies in Chemical Engineering in 2004 and, along with being awarded the scholarship, was named the Learning Cape Festival Icon by the Western Cape
